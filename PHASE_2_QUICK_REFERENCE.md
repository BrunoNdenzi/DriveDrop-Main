## 🚀 9 API Endpoints Ready

| Method | Endpoint | Access | Purpose |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| POST | `/api/v1/shipments/:id/driver-en-route` | Driver | Start trip to pickup |
| POST | `/api/v1/shipments/:id/driver-arrived` | Driver | Arrived (GPS verified) |
| POST | `/api/v1/shipments/:id/start-verification` | Driver | Begin verification |
| POST | `/api/v1/shipments/:id/verification-photos` | Driver | Upload photos |
| POST | `/api/v1/shipments/:id/submit-verification` | Driver | Submit decision |
| POST | `/api/v1/shipments/:id/client-response` | Client | Approve/dispute |
| POST | `/api/v1/shipments/:id/cancel-at-pickup` | All | Cancel shipment |
| PATCH | `/api/v1/shipments/:id/pickup-status` | Driver | Update status |
| GET | `/api/v1/shipments/:id/verification` | All | Get verification |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NEXT STEP

### Regenerate Supabase Types

The mobile app has TypeScript errors because Supabase types don't include new tables. You MUST run:

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > mobile/src/lib/database.types.ts
```

**Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`** with your actual Supabase project ID from the dashboard.

This will fix ALL the TypeScript errors in:
- `mobile/src/services/pickupVerificationService.ts`

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Endpoints (use Postman/Thunder Client)

**Example: Mark Driver En Route**
```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/shipments/{shipmentId}/driver-en-route
Authorization: Bearer {your-jwt-token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "location": {
    "lat": 34.0522,
    "lng": -118.2437
  }
}
```

**Example: Start Verification**
```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/shipments/{shipmentId}/start-verification
Authorization: Bearer {your-jwt-token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "location": {
    "lat": 34.0522,
    "lng": -118.2437,
    "accuracy": 10
  }
}
```

### 3. Check Errors
```bash
cd backend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

All TypeScript compilation should pass with **0 errors**.

## 💰 Refund Logic

| Cancellation Type | Client Refund | Driver Compensation | Platform Fee |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Before acceptance | 95% | 0% | 5% |
| After accept, before arrival | 80% | 10% | 10% |
| At pickup - mismatch | 70% | 20% | 10% |
| At pickup - fraud | 0% | 40% | 60% |

Calculated via database function: `calculate_cancellation_refund()`
