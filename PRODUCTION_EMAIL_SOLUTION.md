# Production Email Solution - Gmail Blocking Issue

## The Problem

Gmail is blocking ALL emails from your SendGrid account with:
```
bounce_classification: "Reputation"
550 5.7.1 Gmail has detected that this message is likely unsolicited mail
```

This happens because:
- **New SendGrid account** = Zero sender reputation
- **Gmail is the strictest provider** (blocks ~80% of new senders)
- **Domain authentication alone isn't enough** for new accounts
- Takes 2-4 weeks to build reputation on SendGrid

## Why This Is Critical for Launch

‚ùå **60% of users use Gmail** - They won't receive verification emails
‚ùå **Can't launch if most users can't sign up**
‚ùå **Password reset won't work for Gmail users**
‚ùå **Professional reputation at stake**

### Solution 2: Use Gmail SMTP Temporarily + Build SendGrid Reputation

Use Gmail for launch, gradually transition to SendGrid.

**Phase 1: Launch with Gmail SMTP (Day 1-7)**

**Setup:**
1. Enable 2FA: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Create App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Update Supabase SMTP:
   ```
   Host: smtp.gmail.com
   Port: 587
   Username: your-gmail@gmail.com
   Password: [16-char app password]
   Sender: your-gmail@gmail.com
   ```

**Limitations:**
‚ö†Ô∏è 500 emails/day limit (enough for initial launch)
‚ö†Ô∏è Sender shows as Gmail (not professional)
‚ö†Ô∏è Not scalable long-term

**Phase 2: Build SendGrid Reputation (Day 8-30)**

While using Gmail, warm up SendGrid:
1. Send 10 emails/day to yourself from SendGrid
2. Open them, click links, reply
3. Gradually increase: 20/day, 50/day, 100/day
4. After 2-3 weeks, switch back to SendGrid
