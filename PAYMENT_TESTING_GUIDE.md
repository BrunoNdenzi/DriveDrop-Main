## üß™ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Open Mobile App
- Launch DriveDrop mobile app
- Ensure you're logged in as a **client** (not driver)
- Navigate to "Create Shipment" or "New Booking"

### Step 2: Enter Pickup Details
- **Address**: Dallas, Texas 75202
- **Date**: Select date 1-2 days from now
- **Notes**: (optional) "Test shipment - Dallas to San Diego"

**‚úÖ Expected**: Distance calculator starts working in background

### Step 3: Enter Delivery Details
- **Address**: San Diego, California 92116
- **Date**: Select date 7+ days from pickup (for flexible pricing)
- **Notes**: (optional) "Deliver to residential driveway"

**‚úÖ Expected**: 
- Distance updates to ~1,359 miles (NOT 500!)
- Price updates to ~$1,226 flexible (NOT $855!)

### Step 4: Enter Vehicle Details
- **Year**: 2021
- **Make**: Nissan
- **Model**: Altima
- **Type**: Sedan (should be auto-selected)
- **Condition**: Operable

**‚úÖ Expected**: 
- Form accepts all inputs
- No validation errors
- Title auto-generated: "Vehicle Transport - Nissan Altima"

### Step 5: Review Summary
- Check shipment summary screen
- **Verify Distance**: Should show ~1,359 miles
- **Verify Price**: Should show ~$1,226 (flexible) or ~$1,291 (standard) or ~$1,614 (expedited)
- **Verify Vehicle**: 2021 Nissan Altima displayed correctly

**‚úÖ Expected**: All values match expected pricing

### Step 6: Navigate to Payment
- Tap "Continue to Payment" or "Proceed to Checkout"
- **CRITICAL CHECK**: Look for "Initializing payment..." message

**‚úÖ Expected**:
- ‚úÖ "Initializing payment..." appears
- ‚úÖ NO error message
- ‚úÖ NO "RLS policy violation" error
- ‚úÖ Payment form loads successfully

**‚ùå Before Fix (Failure)**:
```
‚ùå Error: Failed to create shipment
‚ùå Could not initialize payment
‚ùå Railway logs: "new row violates row-level security policy"
```

### Step 7: Enter Payment Details
Use Stripe test card:
- **Card Number**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Expiry**: 12/25 (or any future date)
- **CVC**: 123 (or any 3 digits)
- **ZIP**: 75202

**‚úÖ Expected**:

- No Stripe errors
- "Pay Now" button enabled

### Step 8: Complete Payment
- Tap "Pay Now" or "Complete Payment"
- Wait for processing (should be 2-5 seconds)

**‚úÖ Expected**:

- ‚úÖ Success confirmation screen
- ‚úÖ Shipment ID displayed
- ‚úÖ "Your booking is confirmed" message
- ‚úÖ Option to view shipment details

**‚ùå Before Fix (Failure)**:
```
‚ùå Payment processing failed
‚ùå Shipment not created
‚ùå Error logged in Railway
```

### Step 9: Verify Database
Check Supabase dashboard or run SQL:

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  title,
  vehicle_year,
  vehicle_make,
  vehicle_model,
  vehicle_type,
  distance,
  estimated_price,
  pickup_date,
  delivery_date,
  status,
  pickup_address,
  delivery_address,
  created_at
FROM shipments 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**‚úÖ Expected Result**:
```
title: "Vehicle Transport - Nissan Altima"
vehicle_year: 2021
vehicle_make: "Nissan"
vehicle_model: "Altima"
vehicle_type: "sedan"
distance: 1358.9 (or close to this)
estimated_price: 1226.41 (flexible) or similar
pickup_date: <selected date>
delivery_date: <selected date>
status: "pending"
pickup_address: "Dallas, Texas 75202"
delivery_address: "San Diego, California 92116"
```

**‚ùå Before Fix (Nothing saved)**:
- No new record created
- RLS policy blocked insertion

### Step 10: Verify Payment Record
Check payments table:

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  shipment_id,
  client_id,
  amount,
  status,
  stripe_payment_intent_id,
  created_at
FROM payments 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

**‚úÖ Expected Result**:
```
shipment_id: <matches shipment from step 9>
amount: 1226.41 (or close, depending on delivery type)
status: "succeeded" or "pending"
stripe_payment_intent_id: "pi_xxxxx..." (valid Stripe ID)
```

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

### Railway Logs
Watch Railway deployment logs in real-time:
```
https://railway.app/project/<project-id>/service/<service-id>/logs
```

**‚úÖ Look for SUCCESS**:
```
[INFO] Shipment created successfully: <shipment-id>
[INFO] Payment intent created: pi_xxxxx...
```

**‚ùå Before Fix (ERROR)**:
```
[ERROR] Error creating shipment
[ERROR] new row violates row-level security policy for table "shipments"
shipmentData: {
  ...
  scheduled_pickup: undefined,  // ‚ùå Was present
  title: undefined,             // ‚ùå Was missing
  vehicle_year: undefined,      // ‚ùå Was missing
  ...
}
```

**‚úÖ After Fix (SUCCESS)**:
```
[INFO] Shipment created with data: {
  client_id: "...",
  title: "Vehicle Transport - Nissan Altima",     // ‚úÖ Present
  vehicle_year: 2021,                              // ‚úÖ Present
  vehicle_make: "Nissan",                          // ‚úÖ Present
  vehicle_model: "Altima",                         // ‚úÖ Present
  distance: 1358.9,                                // ‚úÖ Present
  estimated_price: 1226.41,                        // ‚úÖ Present
  status: "pending",                               // ‚úÖ Present
  // scheduled_pickup removed                      // ‚úÖ Removed
}
[INFO] Shipment created successfully: d4a8f...
```

### Mobile Console Logs
If using Expo development build, check console:

**‚úÖ Expected Logs**:
```
Creating shipment with full details: {
  title: "Vehicle Transport - Nissan Altima",
  vehicle_year: 2021,
  vehicle_make: "Nissan",
  vehicle_model: "Altima",
  vehicle_type: "sedan",
  distance_miles: 1359,
  estimated_price: 1226.41,
  pickup_date: "2025-10-15",
  delivery_date: "2025-10-22",
  status: "pending",
  ...
}
Shipment created successfully: { id: "...", ... }
```

### Supabase Dashboard
Check RLS policy violations:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Database ‚Üí Tables ‚Üí shipments
3. Check "Recent Queries" or "Query Stats"

**‚úÖ Expected**: No RLS policy violations
**‚ùå Before Fix**: Multiple "row violates RLS policy" errors

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Initializing payment..." but then error
**Possible Cause**: Backend still has old code (deployment not complete)
**Solution**: 
1. Check Railway deployment status
2. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
3. Try again

### Issue 2: Distance still shows 500 miles
**Possible Cause**: Mobile app using cached code
**Solution**:
1. Force quit mobile app
2. Clear app cache: `npx expo start --clear`
3. Rebuild app if using development build
4. Test again

### Issue 3: Price still shows $855
**Possible Cause**: Related to Issue 2 (distance wrong)
**Solution**: Same as Issue 2 (clear cache, rebuild)

### Issue 4: RLS policy error still occurs
**Possible Cause**: Database hasn't updated, or missing migration
**Solution**:
1. Check if `title` column exists in shipments table:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'shipments'
   AND column_name IN ('title', 'vehicle_year', 'vehicle_make', 'vehicle_model');
   ```
2. If columns missing, run appropriate migration
3. Check RLS policies are correct

### Issue 5: Payment succeeds but shipment not saved
**Possible Cause**: Payment created before shipment (race condition)
**Solution**: This is actually prevented by our flow (shipment created first), but if it happens:
1. Check Railway logs for the actual error
2. Verify all required fields are in the request
3. May need to add transaction to ensure atomicity
