# Client-Side Notifications Implementation

## Overview
Implemented real-time notification functionality for client users in the HomeScreen, matching the design and behavior of the driver-side notifications.

## Changes Made

### 1. **HomeScreen.tsx** - Complete Notification System

#### Imports Added
```typescript
import { supabase } from '../../lib/supabase';
```

#### State Management
- Removed hardcoded sample notifications
- Added `unreadNotifications` state to track real notification count
- Removed unused `showNotifications` state and `Notification` type

#### Notification Count Fetching
Added notification count query in `fetchShipmentData()`:
```typescript
// Fetch notification count (recent status updates in last 7 days)
const sevenDaysAgo = new Date();
sevenDaysAgo.setDate(sevenDaysAgo.getDate() - 7);

const { data: recentUpdates } = await supabase
  .from('shipments')
  .select('id')
  .eq('client_id', userProfile.id)
  .in('status', ['assigned', 'accepted', 'picked_up', 'in_transit', 'delivered'])
  .gte('updated_at', sevenDaysAgo.toISOString());

setUnreadNotifications(recentUpdates?.length || 0);
```

#### Notification Handler Implementation
Completely rewrote `handleNotifications()` to fetch real shipment updates:

**Features:**
- Fetches shipment status updates from last 7 days
- Queries shipments table with JOIN to driver profiles
- Filters by active statuses: `['assigned', 'accepted', 'picked_up', 'in_transit', 'delivered']`
- Shows driver name, shipment details, and formatted price
- Uses emoji status indicators (âœ…, ðŸ“¦, ðŸšš)
- Displays in Alert dialog (consistent with driver side)
- Provides navigation to "My Shipments" screen
- Refreshes dashboard after viewing

**Status Messages:**
- `assigned` â†’ âœ… DRIVER ASSIGNED
- `accepted` â†’ âœ… ACCEPTED BY DRIVER
- `picked_up` â†’ ðŸ“¦ PICKED UP
- `in_transit` â†’ ðŸšš IN TRANSIT
- `delivered` â†’ âœ… DELIVERED

#### UI Updates
Updated notification badge to match driver side:
```typescript
{notifications > 0 && (
  <View style={styles.notificationBadge}>
    <Text style={styles.notificationCount}>
      {notifications > 9 ? '9+' : notifications}
    </Text>
  </View>
)}
```

**Changes:**
- Always shows count when notifications > 0 (previously only showed if > 1)
- Shows "9+" for counts over 9 (prevents badge overflow)
- Maintains consistent design with driver dashboard

## Notification Logic

### What Clients Are Notified About:
1. **Driver Assignment** - When a driver is assigned to their shipment
2. **Shipment Acceptance** - When driver accepts the job
3. **Pickup Confirmation** - When shipment is picked up
4. **In Transit Updates** - When shipment is in transit
5. **Delivery Completion** - When shipment is delivered

### Notification Window:
- Shows updates from **last 7 days**
- Automatically refreshes on screen focus
- Updates after viewing notifications

### Data Fetched:
- Shipment ID, title, status
- Pickup and delivery addresses
- Estimated price (formatted correctly with /100)
- Driver name (first and last)
- Last update timestamp

## Design Consistency

### Similarities with Driver Side:
âœ… Same Alert.alert dialog approach
âœ… Same 7-day notification window
âœ… Same badge styling and positioning
âœ… Same count display logic (shows actual number or 9+)
âœ… Same status formatting with emojis
âœ… Same navigation pattern after viewing
âœ… Same data refresh after interaction

### Differences (Role-Specific):
- **Driver**: Shows job application responses (accepted/rejected)
- **Client**: Shows shipment status updates (assigned/picked_up/delivered)
- **Driver**: Navigates to "Applications" tab
- **Client**: Navigates to "My Shipments" screen

## Database Queries

### Notification Count Query:
```sql
SELECT id 
FROM shipments 
WHERE client_id = ? 
  AND status IN ('assigned', 'accepted', 'picked_up', 'in_transit', 'delivered')
  AND updated_at >= ?
```

### Notification Details Query:
```sql
SELECT 
  id, title, status, pickup_address, delivery_address, 
  estimated_price, updated_at, driver_id,
  profiles:driver_id (first_name, last_name)
FROM shipments 
WHERE client_id = ? 
  AND status IN ('assigned', 'accepted', 'picked_up', 'in_transit', 'delivered')
  AND updated_at >= ?
ORDER BY updated_at DESC 
LIMIT 10
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click notification bell with no notifications â†’ Shows "No recent updates"
- [ ] Click notification bell with notifications â†’ Shows formatted list
- [ ] Badge shows correct count (1-9 or 9+)
- [ ] Status emojis display correctly
- [ ] Driver names show properly
- [ ] Prices display correctly (with /100 conversion)
- [ ] "View My Shipments" button navigates correctly
- [ ] Dashboard refreshes after viewing notifications
- [ ] Badge count updates after refresh
- [ ] 7-day window filters correctly
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh updates notification count

## Error Handling

1. **No User Profile**: Returns early if `userProfile?.id` is undefined
2. **Database Errors**: Catches errors and shows "Failed to load notifications" alert
3. **Empty Notifications**: Shows user-friendly message "No recent updates on your shipments"
4. **Missing Driver Info**: Gracefully handles null driver profile with default "Driver" text

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future releases:
1. **Read/Unread Tracking**: Add `last_viewed_at` field to track which notifications user has seen
2. **Push Notifications**: Integrate with Expo Push Notifications for real-time alerts
3. **Notification Preferences**: Allow users to choose which updates they want to see
4. **Detailed View**: Add full notification history screen (instead of just Alert)
5. **Mark as Read**: Add ability to mark individual notifications as read
6. **Filter by Status**: Allow filtering notifications by shipment status

## Code Quality

- âœ… Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- âœ… Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- âœ… Proper error handling throughout
- âœ… Clean removal of unused code (modal, types)
- âœ… Maintains existing functionality
- âœ… Uses Supabase best practices
