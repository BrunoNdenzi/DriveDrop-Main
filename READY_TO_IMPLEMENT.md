## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

### Before (Business Risk)

- ❌ Clients upload photos at booking
- ❌ Drivers accept jobs blindly
- ❌ No verification at pickup
- ❌ Disputes about vehicle condition
- ❌ Unclear liability for damage
- ❌ Fraud potential (wrong vehicle, fake photos)

### After (Comprehensive Solution)

- ✅ 6+ driver photos required at pickup
- ✅ Side-by-side comparison with client photos
- ✅ GPS verified location (within 100m)
- ✅ 3 verification outcomes (matches/minor/major)
- ✅ Fair cancellation policies with refund splits
- ✅ Complete audit trail with timestamps
- ✅ Fraud detection built-in

---

## 📈 New Capabilities

### Status Tracking (9 statuses now)

```
Old (5): pending → accepted → picked_up → in_transit → delivered

New (9): pending → accepted → driver_en_route → driver_arrived 
         → pickup_verification_pending → pickup_verified 
         → picked_up → in_transit → delivered
```

### GPS Verification

- Driver must be within **100 meters** of pickup address
- Uses Haversine formula for accuracy
- Blocks fake "I've arrived" clicks
- Shows actual distance in error message

### Photo Requirements

- **Minimum 6 photos** enforced
- Required angles: front, rear, both sides, both front quarters
- Optional: interior, odometer, damage close-ups
- Stored in Supabase Storage with public URLs
- GPS coordinates and timestamp on each photo

### Verification Decisions

1. **✅ Matches** → Auto-approve → Continue pickup
2. **⚠️ Minor Differences** → Alert client → 5-minute timer → Approve or Cancel
3. **❌ Major Issues** → Auto-cancel → Refund client 70% → Compensate driver 20%

### Refund Matrix

| Cancellation Type | Client | Driver | Platform |
|-------------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Before acceptance | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| After acceptance, before pickup | 80% | 10% | 10% |
| At pickup - mismatch | 70% | 20% | 10% |
| At pickup - fraud | 0% | 40% | 60% |
| During transit | 50% | 40% | 10% |
| Force majeure | 90% | 5% | 5% |

## 🗄️ Database Schema Highlights

### New Tables

1. **pickup_verifications** (20 columns)
   - Stores driver photos, GPS, decision, differences
   - Links to shipment and driver
   - Tracks client response and timing

2. **cancellation_records** (25 columns)
   - Financial breakdown (refund, compensation, fees)
   - Refund status tracking (pending → processing → completed)
   - Evidence URLs, admin notes
   - Stripe refund/transfer IDs

### New Functions

1. **calculate_cancellation_refund()** - Returns client_refund, driver_compensation, platform_fee
2. **update_shipment_status_safe()** - Validates transitions, logs history
3. **is_valid_status_transition()** - Prevents invalid status jumps

### RLS Policies

- Drivers see only their verifications
- Clients see verifications for their shipments
- Only assigned driver can create/update
- Admin has full access

---

## 🎨 Mobile UI Needed (Phase 3)

### Driver App Components

1. **DriverShipmentDetailScreen** (update existing)
   - Add status-based action buttons
   - "Start Trip" → driver_en_route
   - "I've Arrived" → driver_arrived (GPS check)
   - "Start Verification" → opens camera flow

2. **DriverPickupVerificationScreen** (new)
   - Camera interface
   - Photo angle selector (6 required)
   - Progress: "3 of 6 photos taken"
   - Side-by-side comparison view
   - Decision selector (Matches/Minor/Major)
   - Notes field
   - Submit button (disabled until 6 photos)

3. **PhotoComparisonView** (new)
   - Split screen: Client Photo | Driver Photo
   - Swipe between angles
   - Zoom/pan
   - "Mark Difference" tool
   - Annotate specific areas

4. **VerificationDecisionModal** (new)
   - Three cards:
     - ✅ Matches → Green → "Proceed with pickup"
     - ⚠️ Minor → Orange → "Alert client, may cancel"
     - ❌ Major → Red → "Cancel & refund 70%"
   - Confirm button

### Client App Components

5. **ClientPickupAlertModal** (new)
   - Shows when driver finds minor differences
   - Side-by-side photos
   - Countdown: "Respond in 4:32"
   - Two buttons:
     - "Approve Pickup" (green)
     - "Cancel & Get Refund" (red)
   - Refund amount shown: "$350 (70% refund)"

6. **ShipmentTrackingScreen** (update existing)
   - Add status-specific views
   - driver_en_route → Live map with driver dot
   - driver_arrived → "Driver is here!"
   - pickup_verification_pending → "Verifying vehicle..." spinner
   - pickup_verified → "✅ Verification complete"

## 🔔 Notifications Summary

### Push Notifications (11 events)

| Trigger | Client | Driver |
|---------|--------|--------|
| accepted | "Driver assigned!" | "New shipment accepted" |
| driver_en_route | "Driver on the way! ETA: 30 min" | "Navigate to pickup" |
| driver_arrived | "Driver has arrived" | "Complete verification" |
| pickup_verification_pending | "Driver verifying..." | - |
| minor_differences_found | "⚠️ Review within 5 min!" | "Waiting for client..." |
| pickup_verified | "✅ Verified! Loading now." | "Load vehicle" |
| picked_up | "Vehicle loaded!" | "Start delivery" |
| in_transit | "In transit. Track progress." | "Safe travels!" |
| delivered | "🎉 Delivered!" | "Payment released" |
| cancelled | "Cancelled. Refund: $X" | "Cancelled. Comp: $Y" |

### SMS (Critical Only)

- Driver arrived
- Verification issues found
- Picked up
- Delivered

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Database Tests

```sql
-- Run verification queries in 01_pickup_verification_schema.sql
-- Should return 9 statuses, 2 tables, 3 functions
```

### Service Tests

```typescript
// Test status transitions
await PickupVerificationService.markDriverEnRoute(shipmentId, driverId);
await PickupVerificationService.markDriverArrived(shipmentId, driverId, location);
// Should fail if > 100m away

// Test verification flow
const verification = await PickupVerificationService.startVerification(request);
await PickupVerificationService.uploadVerificationPhoto(verificationId, 'front', uri, location);
// Upload 6 photos...
await PickupVerificationService.submitVerification(request);
```

### Integration Tests

1. **Happy path:** accepted → ... → delivered
2. **Minor differences approved:** verification → client approves → pickup
3. **Minor differences disputed:** verification → client disputes → cancelled
4. **Major issues:** verification → major → auto-cancel
5. **GPS blocking:** driver 200m away → error on mark arrived
6. **Photo requirement:** < 6 photos → cannot submit

## 💡 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Apply Database Migration

```bash
# Option A: Supabase Dashboard
1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
2. Copy content of backend/scripts/01_pickup_verification_schema.sql
3. Paste and click "Run"
4. Verify: Should see "Success. No rows returned."
5. Check tables exist: pickup_verifications, cancellation_records

# Option B: Supabase CLI
supabase db push
```

### 2. Test Database Functions

```sql
-- Test refund calculation
SELECT * FROM calculate_cancellation_refund(
  p_original_amount := 500.00,
  p_cancellation_type := 'at_pickup_mismatch',
  p_fraud_confirmed := false
);
-- Expected: client_refund: 350.00, driver_compensation: 100.00, platform_fee: 50.00

-- Test status transition
SELECT is_valid_status_transition('accepted', 'driver_en_route');
-- Expected: TRUE

SELECT is_valid_status_transition('accepted', 'picked_up');
-- Expected: FALSE (must go through intermediate statuses)
```

### 3. Test Mobile Types

```typescript
// In any React Native component
import { ShipmentStatus } from '../types/shipment';
import { PickupVerification } from '../types/pickupVerification';
import { CancellationRecord } from '../types/cancellation';

// All types should autocomplete with new statuses
const status: ShipmentStatus = 'driver_en_route'; // ✓
const status2: ShipmentStatus = 'pickup_verified'; // ✓
```
