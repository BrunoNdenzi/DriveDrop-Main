## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Types (Current PR)
**Status: In Progress**

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] Shared TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/`
- [ ] Service layer stubs with proper typing
- [ ] Basic component architecture
- [ ] Navigation structure skeleton
- [ ] Development tooling (ESLint, TypeScript, testing setup)

#### Key Types to Implement:
```typescript
// Core business entities
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'client' | 'driver' | 'admin';
  profile: UserProfile;
}

interface Shipment {
  id: string;
  client_id: string;
  driver_id?: string;
  status: ShipmentStatus;
  pickup_location: Location;
  delivery_location: Location;
  tracking_events: TrackingEvent[];
}

interface Location {
  address: string;
  coordinates: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
  };
  notes?: string;
}

// API Response wrapper
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  success: boolean;
  message?: string;
}

// Dashboard metrics
interface DashboardStats {
  total_shipments: number;
  active_shipments: number;
  completed_shipments: number;
  revenue: number;
  driver_count: number;
}
```

### Phase 2: Service Layer Implementation
**Dependencies: Phase 1**

#### API Service Architecture:
- **clientService.ts**: Client-specific operations
  - `createShipment(data: CreateShipmentData): Promise<ApiResponse<Shipment>>`
  - `getShipments(filters?: ShipmentFilters): Promise<ApiResponse<Shipment[]>>`
  - `trackShipment(id: string): Promise<ApiResponse<TrackingEvent[]>>`

- **driverService.ts**: Driver-specific operations
  - `getAvailableJobs(location: Location): Promise<ApiResponse<Shipment[]>>`
  - `acceptJob(shipmentId: string): Promise<ApiResponse<Shipment>>`
  - `updateShipmentStatus(shipmentId: string, status: ShipmentStatus): Promise<ApiResponse<void>>`

- **adminService.ts**: Administrative operations
  - `getDashboard(): Promise<ApiResponse<DashboardStats>>`
  - `assignShipment(shipmentId: string, driverId: string): Promise<ApiResponse<void>>`
  - `getSystemMetrics(): Promise<ApiResponse<SystemMetrics>>`

#### Error Handling Strategy:
- Centralized error handling with typed error responses
- Network retry logic for failed requests
- Offline queue for critical operations
- User-friendly error messages with fallback options

### Phase 3: State Management & Hooks
**Dependencies: Phase 2**

#### Custom Hooks:
- **useShipments**: Shipment data management with caching
- **useAuth**: Authentication state and user management
- **useLocation**: Real-time location tracking
- **useNotifications**: Push notification handling
- **useOfflineQueue**: Offline operation management

#### State Architecture:
```typescript
// Context-based state management
interface AppState {
  user: User | null;
  shipments: Shipment[];
  location: Location | null;
  networkStatus: 'online' | 'offline';
  notifications: Notification[];
}

// Hook implementation example
function useShipments() {
  const [shipments, setShipments] = useState<Shipment[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  // Implementation with caching, error handling, and real-time updates
  return { shipments, loading, error, refetch, createShipment };
}
```

### Phase 4: UI Components & Design System
**Dependencies: Phase 3**

#### Component Library:
- **Atomic Design Methodology**: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Platform Consistency**: iOS and Android design guidelines
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode with consistent branding

#### Core Components:
- Navigation components (headers, tabs, drawers)
- Form components (inputs, buttons, pickers)
- Data display (lists, cards, modals)
- Feedback components (loading, errors, empty states)
- Map integration components

### Phase 5: Screen Implementation
**Dependencies: Phase 4**

#### Screen Categories:
1. **Authentication**: Login, Registration, Password Reset
2. **Client Screens**: Shipment creation, tracking, history
3. **Driver Screens**: Job board, active deliveries, earnings
4. **Admin Screens**: Dashboard, user management, analytics
5. **Shared Screens**: Profile, settings, notifications

#### Navigation Flow:
```
AuthStack → (Login, Register, ForgotPassword)
    ↓ (authenticated)
AppStack → RoleBasedTabs
    ├── ClientStack → (Home, CreateShipment, TrackShipment, History)
    ├── DriverStack → (Dashboard, AvailableJobs, ActiveDeliveries, Earnings)
    └── AdminStack → (Dashboard, UserManagement, Analytics, Reports)
```

### Phase 6: Real-time Features
**Dependencies: Phase 5**

#### Real-time Capabilities:
- **Live Tracking**: Driver location updates for clients
- **Status Updates**: Real-time shipment status changes
- **Push Notifications**: Delivery updates and important alerts
- **Chat System**: Client-driver communication
- **Live Dashboard**: Admin metrics with real-time updates

#### Technology Integration:
- Supabase Real-time subscriptions
- Expo Notifications for push messaging
- WebSocket fallback for unstable connections
- Background task handling for location updates

### Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Dependencies: Phase 6**

#### Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Service layer, utilities, and hooks
- **Integration Tests**: API integration and data flow
- **Component Tests**: UI component behavior and accessibility
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys
- **Performance Tests**: Load times, memory usage, battery impact

#### Quality Gates:
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Zero TypeScript errors
- ESLint compliance with zero warnings
- Accessibility audit passing
- Performance benchmarks met

### Phase 8: Production Readiness
**Dependencies: Phase 7**

#### Production Checklist:
- [ ] Error monitoring (Sentry integration)
- [ ] Analytics implementation (Mixpanel/Firebase)
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Security audit completion
- [ ] App store compliance (privacy policies, permissions)

- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of subscriptions and listeners

### Security Implementation
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Authentication**: Secure token management with refresh strategies
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation with server-side verification
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and request signing

### Accessibility Standards
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper labels and navigation
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44pt touch targets
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance

- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user motion preferences

### Platform Considerations
- **iOS Guidelines**: Human Interface Guidelines compliance
- **Android Guidelines**: Material Design principles
- **Expo Compatibility**: Managed vs bare workflow decisions
- **Device Support**: Testing across various screen sizes and OS versions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **State Management Complexity**: Use proven patterns and gradual migration
- **Real-time Performance**: Implement fallbacks and optimize update frequency
- **Offline Functionality**: Robust queue system with conflict resolution
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Regular security audits and update strategies

### Development Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to phase-based development
