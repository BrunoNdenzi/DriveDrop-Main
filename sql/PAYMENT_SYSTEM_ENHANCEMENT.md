# DriveDrop Payment System Enhancement
## Implementation Summary - July 29, 2025

## 1. Split Payment Model (20%/80%)

### Overview
The DriveDrop payment system has been enhanced with a split payment model:
- **Initial Payment (20%)**: Collected at the time of booking
- **Final Payment (80%)**: Collected upon successful delivery
- **Refund Policy**: 1-hour window for refunds on initial payments

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Schema**: Enhanced payments table with additional columns:
  - `initial_amount`: The 20% initial payment amount (in cents)
  - `remaining_amount`: The 80% remaining payment amount (in cents)
  - `booking_timestamp`: When the initial payment was made
  - `refund_deadline`: Calculated as 1 hour after booking
  - `is_refundable`: Boolean flag for refund eligibility
  - `payment_type`: Either 'initial' (20%) or 'final' (80%)
  - `parent_payment_id`: Links final payment to initial payment

- **Payment Processing Flow**:
  1. User books shipment and makes 20% initial payment
  2. On delivery completion, user makes 80% final payment
  3. Within 1 hour of booking, user can request refund

## 2. New API Endpoints

### Refund Eligibility Check
```
GET /api/v1/payments/:id/refund-eligibility
```
- **Description**: Checks if a payment is eligible for refund
- **Response**: `{ eligible: boolean, deadline: ISO-timestamp, timeRemaining: seconds }`
- **Security**: Authenticated, user must own the payment

### Process Refund
```
POST /api/v1/payments/:id/refund
```
- **Description**: Processes a refund for an eligible payment
- **Response**: Refund details including status and refund ID
- **Security**: Authenticated, user must own the payment, must be within refund window

### Final Payment
```
POST /api/v1/payments/:id/final-payment
```
- **Description**: Creates the final 80% payment for a shipment
- **Parameters**: `{ parentPaymentId: UUID, shipmentId: UUID }`
- **Response**: Payment intent details for processing the final payment
- **Security**: Authenticated, user must own the initial payment

## 3. Mobile UI Components

### Payment Policy Card
- **Component**: `PaymentPolicyCard.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Displays payment breakdown (20% initial, 80% final)
  - Shows refund eligibility and countdown timer if applicable
  - Provides user education about payment policies
  - Adaptive UI for both booking and completion phases

### Payment Flow UI
- **Initial Payment Screen**: Shows 20% calculation with total
- **Shipment Details Screen**: Shows payment status and remaining balance
- **Delivery Completion Screen**: Prompts for final 80% payment

## 4. Database Functions

### Refund Eligibility Check
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_refund_eligibility(payment_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
```
- **Purpose**: Validates if a payment can be refunded based on:
  - Must be an initial payment
  - Must be within refund deadline (1 hour from booking)
  - Payment must be completed and marked as refundable

### Final Payment Processing
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_final_payment(
  p_shipment_id UUID,
  p_client_id UUID,
  p_parent_payment_id UUID
)
```
- **Purpose**: Handles creation of final payment by:
  - Validating initial payment exists and is completed
  - Checking if final payment has already been made
  - Calculating the correct remaining amount (80%)

## 5. Security Considerations

- **Row-Level Security**: Enhanced policies to ensure users can only view and modify their own payments
- **Refund Window**: Automatically closes after 1 hour via database trigger
- **Payment Verification**: Validates shipment status before allowing final payment
- **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging for all payment operations

## 6. How to Test the Payment System

### Initial Payment Test
1. Create a new shipment
2. Proceed to payment screen
3. Verify the amount shows 20% of total with explanation
4. Complete payment and verify success

### Refund Test
1. Make an initial payment
2. Navigate to shipment details within 1 hour
3. Request refund and verify success
4. Verify refund is no longer available after 1 hour

### Final Payment Test
1. Complete a shipment with initial payment
2. Navigate to delivery completion screen
3. Verify the remaining 80% amount is displayed
4. Complete final payment and verify success

## 7. Known Limitations

- Refunds are only available for the initial 20% payment
- Partial refunds are not currently supported
- Currency is fixed to USD at this time
- Manual review may be required for disputed transactions
