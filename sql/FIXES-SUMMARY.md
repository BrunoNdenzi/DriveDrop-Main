# DriveDrop Fixes Implementation Summary

## 1. Database Enum Fixes

### Fixed Issues:
- Added missing values to the shipment_status enum including:
  - "assigned"
  - "completed" 
  - "picked_up"

### Implementation:
- Successfully ran migration scripts that:
  1. Safely managed dependencies (triggers, RLS policies)
  2. Modified the enum type to include all necessary values
  3. Re-established all database constraints and policies
  4. Added appropriate notification triggers for the new status values

### Files:
- `04_fix_shipment_status_enum.sql` - Added "assigned" and "completed" values
- `08_add_picked_up_status.sql` - Added "picked_up" value with proper handling of dependencies

## 2. Network Diagnostics

### Fixed Issues:
- Addressed network request failures in the driver application fetching functionality
- Provided tools to diagnose API connectivity issues

### Implementation:
- Created diagnostic tools:
  1. Backend API endpoint testing script
  2. Mobile app Network Diagnostic screen
  3. Environment variable verification utilities

### Files:
- `scripts/test-api-endpoint.js` - Tests the backend API endpoints
- `mobile/scripts/verify-mobile-env.js` - Verifies environment variables
- `mobile/src/screens/NetworkDiagnosticScreen.tsx` - UI for network diagnostics
- `backend/scripts/check-driver-api.js` - Checks API endpoint configuration

## 3. Environment Configuration

### Fixed Issues:
- Provided proper examples for environment configuration
- Added verification scripts to ensure correct setup

### Implementation:
- Created sample environment files
- Added environment checking logic
- Included startup scripts with environment verification

### Files:
- `mobile/.env.sample` - Example environment variables for mobile app
- `start-testing.sh` - Script to test the entire application stack

## 4. UI Integration

### Implementation:
- Added Network Diagnostic screen to driver profile screen
- Updated navigation to include the diagnostic tool
- Made the diagnostic screen accessible via profile page

### Files:
- `mobile/src/navigation/index.tsx` - Added screen to navigation stack
- `mobile/src/navigation/types.ts` - Updated navigation types
- `mobile/src/screens/driver/DriverProfileScreen.tsx` - Added diagnostic option

## Testing Instructions

1. Ensure all SQL migration files have been run successfully
2. Set up environment variables in `.env` files
3. Start backend and mobile app
4. Use the Network Diagnostic tool in the driver app to verify connectivity
5. Test shipment status changes to verify all enum values work correctly
6. If issues persist, use the diagnostic scripts to identify specific problems

- `start-testing.sh` - For comprehensive application testing
- Network Diagnostic screen in the app - For on-device network diagnostics
