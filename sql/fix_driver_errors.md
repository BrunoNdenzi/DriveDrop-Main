# Driver App Error Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the driver app errors and data issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Shipment Status Enum Error ✅
- **Problem**: App was using shipment statuses ("assigned", "completed") not defined in the database enum
- **Fix**: Created migration script `04_fix_shipment_status_enum.sql` to update the enum with all needed values
- **Implementation**: 
  - Temporarily dropped RLS policies that reference the shipment_status enum
  - Updated enum to include: 'pending', 'accepted', 'assigned', 'in_transit', 'in_progress', 'delivered', 'completed', 'cancelled'
  - Restored all RLS policies after updating the enum
  - Created `ShipmentUtil.ts` with validation and safe update functions
  - Added status validation in status update functions

### 2. Row-Level Security Policy Error for Messages ✅
- **Problem**: Insert operations violating row-level security for messages table
- **Fix**: Created migration script `05_fix_messages_rls.sql` with improved RLS policy
- **Implementation**:
  - Added stored procedure `send_message()` with proper validation
  - Created `MessageUtil.ts` utility for secure message sending
  - Added graceful fallback if RPC function is not available
  - Improved error handling for permission issues

### 3. Duplicate Driver Settings Error ✅
- **Problem**: Insert for a driver who already has a settings row causing unique constraint violation
- **Fix**: Updated `DriverProfileScreen.tsx` to check for existing settings before saving
- **Implementation**:
  - First checks if settings exist for the driver
  - Uses `update()` for existing settings
  - Uses `insert()` only for new settings
  - Added proper error handling for all cases

### 4. Network Request Failed Error ✅
- **Problem**: Network errors not handled gracefully in the UI
- **Fix**: Created `NetworkUtil.ts` utility with comprehensive network handling
- **Implementation**:
  - Added connection checking
  - Created request wrapper with error handling
  - Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Improved error messages based on error type
  - Updated key functions to check connectivity first

## Migration Scripts
- **04_fix_shipment_status_enum.sql**: Updates shipment_status enum to include all values used in the app
- **05_fix_messages_rls.sql**: Improves RLS policy for messages and adds secure RPC function

## New Utility Files
- **NetworkUtil.ts**: Handles network connectivity and request errors
- **MessageUtil.ts**: Manages secure message sending with error handling
- **ShipmentUtil.ts**: Handles safe shipment status updates with validation

## Updated Files
- **DriverProfileScreen.tsx**: Fixed duplicate driver settings issue
- **ShipmentDetailsScreen.tsx**: Improved shipment status updates with validation and network error handling

## Verification Checklist
- [x] All errors above are resolved
- [x] Shipment screens use only valid shipment statuses
