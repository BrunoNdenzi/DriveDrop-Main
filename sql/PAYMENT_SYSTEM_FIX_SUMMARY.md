# Payment System Fix Summary

## Identified Issues

1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The payment controller was using `user_id` but the database schema expected `client_id`.

2. **Row-Level Security Policy**: The RLS policy for the payments table was not correctly configured, causing permission errors when inserting payment records.

3. **Payment Split Display**: The UI did not clearly show the 20%/80% payment split to users.

## Implemented Fixes

### Backend Fixes

1. **Payment Controller Update**:
   - Modified the payment controller to use `client_id` instead of `user_id` to match the database schema
   - Updated the payment intent creation to properly calculate the 20% initial payment amount
   - Added detailed metadata to payment intents to track both initial and remaining amounts

2. **RLS Policy Fix**:
   - Created new RLS policies for the payments table in `fix_payments_policy.sql`
   - Added policies for client insertion and viewing of their own payments
   - Added policies for admin access to all payments

### Mobile UI Enhancements

1. **Payment Display Improvements**:
   - Updated `BookingStepPaymentScreen.tsx` to show both the initial 20% payment amount and total shipment value
   - Enhanced the `PaymentPolicyCard` component to clearly explain the payment split and refund policy

2. **Format Utilities**:
   - Added time formatting utilities to `formatters.ts` for displaying deadlines and refund eligibility periods
   - Added a `getTimeRemaining` function to display countdown timers for refund deadlines

## Implementation Details

- The payment amount is now split in both UI and API:
  - Initial payment: 20% of total amount (charged at booking)
  - Final payment: 80% of total amount (to be charged at delivery)

- Enhanced payment display includes:
  - Visual payment split indicator showing 20%/80% proportions
  - Clearly labeled amounts for both initial and final payments
  - Refund policy information with countdown timer
  - Detailed payment breakdown

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Run the payment policy SQL script in the Supabase SQL Editor
2. Start the backend with the updated payment controller
3. Test the booking flow in the mobile app to verify the payment split is displayed correctly
4. Confirm the payment intent is created with the correct amount (20% of total)
5. Verify that payment records are successfully created in the database

## Next Steps

- Implement the final payment collection at delivery
- Add email notifications for payment confirmations
- Create a payment history screen in the mobile app
