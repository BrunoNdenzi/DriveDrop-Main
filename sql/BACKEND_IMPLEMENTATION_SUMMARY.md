# Backend Driver Application Flow - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Task Completed: Section 2.1 of DriveDrop Prioritized Checklist

### ✅ Endpoints Successfully Implemented

1. **POST /api/v1/shipments/:id/apply**
   - Allows authenticated drivers to apply for shipments
   - Includes optional application notes
   - Prevents duplicate applications
   - Validates shipment availability

2. **GET /api/v1/drivers/applications**
   - Returns all applications for the authenticated driver
   - Supports optional status filtering
   - Includes enriched shipment data

3. **PUT /api/v1/applications/:id/status**
   - Admin: Can accept/reject any application
   - Driver: Can cancel their own applications only
   - Automatic shipment assignment on acceptance

### 🔒 Security & Authorization

- **Supabase Auth** integration for all endpoints
- **Role-based access control** (driver/admin permissions)
- **Ownership validation** for driver actions
- **Input validation** and sanitization
