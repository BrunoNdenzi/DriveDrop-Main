## 🚀 API Endpoints Created

### 1. Driver Status Updates

#### POST `/api/v1/shipments/:id/driver-en-route`
- **Access:** Driver only
- **Purpose:** Mark driver as en route to pickup
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "location": {
      "lat": 34.0522,
      "lng": -118.2437
    }
  }
  ```

#### POST `/api/v1/shipments/:id/driver-arrived`
- **Access:** Driver only
- **Purpose:** Mark driver arrived (GPS verified within 100m)
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "location": {
      "lat": 34.0522,
      "lng": -118.2437,
      "accuracy": 10
    }
  }
  ```
- **Validation:** Rejects if >100m from pickup address

---

### 2. Verification Workflow

#### POST `/api/v1/shipments/:id/start-verification`
- **Access:** Driver only
- **Purpose:** Initialize pickup verification process
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "location": {
      "lat": 34.0522,
      "lng": -118.2437,
      "accuracy": 10
    }
  }
  ```
- **Response:** Returns verification ID for photo uploads

#### POST `/api/v1/shipments/:id/verification-photos`
- **Access:** Driver only
- **Purpose:** Upload verification photo
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "verificationId": "uuid",
    "angle": "front",
    "photoUrl": "https://...",
    "location": { "lat": 34.0522, "lng": -118.2437 }
  }
  ```
- **Photo Angles:** front, rear, driver_side, passenger_side, etc.

#### POST `/api/v1/shipments/:id/submit-verification`
- **Access:** Driver only
- **Purpose:** Submit completed verification with decision
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "verificationId": "uuid",
    "decision": "matches|minor_differences|major_issues",
    "differences": [...],
    "driverNotes": "Vehicle condition notes",
    "location": { "lat": 34.0522, "lng": -118.2437 }
  }
  ```
- **Logic:**
  - `matches` → Auto-approve → status: pickup_verified
  - `minor_differences` → Alert client → wait for response
  - `major_issues` → Auto-cancel → process refund

---

### 3. Client Response

#### POST `/api/v1/shipments/:id/client-response`
- **Access:** Client only
- **Purpose:** Client approves or disputes minor differences
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "verificationId": "uuid",
    "response": "approved|disputed",
    "notes": "Optional explanation"
  }
  ```
- **Logic:**
  - `approved` → Proceed with pickup
  - `disputed` → Cancel shipment → refund (70/20/10 split)

---

### 4. Cancellation

#### POST `/api/v1/shipments/:id/cancel-at-pickup`
- **Access:** Driver, Client, or Admin
- **Purpose:** Cancel shipment at pickup with refund calculation
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "cancellationType": "at_pickup_mismatch|at_pickup_fraud|...",
    "reason": "Detailed explanation",
    "pickupVerificationId": "uuid",
    "evidenceUrls": ["url1", "url2"],
    "fraudConfirmed": false
  }
  ```
- **Refund Matrix:**
  - `before_driver_accepts`: 95% client / 0% driver / 5% platform
  - `after_accept_before_arrival`: 80% / 10% / 10%
  - `at_pickup_mismatch`: 70% / 20% / 10%
  - `at_pickup_fraud`: 0% / 40% / 60%

---

### 5. Status Management

#### PATCH `/api/v1/shipments/:id/pickup-status`
- **Access:** Driver only
- **Purpose:** Update shipment status
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "picked_up|in_transit"
  }
  ```

#### GET `/api/v1/shipments/:id/verification`
- **Access:** Driver, Client, or Admin
- **Purpose:** Get verification details for a shipment
- **Response:** Full verification record with photos, decision, timestamps

## 🔐 Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT token validation via Supabase Auth
- ✅ Role-based access control (driver/client/admin)
- ✅ User ID validation for ownership checks

### Data Validation
- ✅ Request body validation (all required fields)
- ✅ GPS coordinate validation
- ✅ Enum validation (status, decision types)
- ✅ Distance verification (100m radius)

### Database Security
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies in place

---

## 📊 Business Logic Implemented

### GPS Verification
- Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
- 100-meter radius enforcement
- Location accuracy tracking

### Photo Requirements
- Minimum 6 photos enforced
- Photo metadata (timestamp, GPS, angle)
- Storage in Supabase Storage (`shipment-photos` bucket)

### Refund Calculation
- Database function: `calculate_cancellation_refund()`
- 6 cancellation scenarios with different splits
- Fraud handling (0% client refund, 40% driver)

### Status Flow Management
- Enforced status transitions
- Database function: `update_shipment_status_safe()`
- Prevents invalid status jumps

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] GPS distance calculation accuracy
- [ ] Refund calculation for all 6 scenarios
- [ ] Status transition validation
- [ ] Photo upload and storage
- [ ] Request validation (all endpoints)

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full verification flow (matches)
- [ ] Client approval flow (minor differences)
- [ ] Client dispute flow (cancellation)
- [ ] Major issues auto-cancel flow
- [ ] GPS blocking (>100m rejection)

### API Tests
- [ ] All 9 endpoints return correct status codes
- [ ] Authentication failures (401)
- [ ] Authorization failures (403)
- [ ] Validation errors (400)
- [ ] Not found errors (404)

---

## ⚠️ Critical Next Steps

### 1. Regenerate Supabase Types (IMMEDIATE)

The mobile app currently has TypeScript errors because the Supabase types don't include the new tables and columns. Run:

```bash
# Get your Supabase project ID from dashboard
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > mobile/src/lib/database.types.ts
```

**Why this is needed:**
- `pickup_verifications` table not in types
- `cancellation_records` table not in types
- New shipment columns (`driver_arrival_time`, `pickup_verified`, etc.)
- New RPC functions (`update_shipment_status_safe`, `calculate_cancellation_refund`)

### 2. Test Backend APIs

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Test endpoints with Postman/Thunder Client:
1. POST /api/v1/shipments/:id/driver-en-route
2. POST /api/v1/shipments/:id/driver-arrived
3. POST /api/v1/shipments/:id/start-verification
4. etc.

### 3. Stripe Refund Integration (Optional - Phase 2.5)

The cancellation logic creates records but doesn't actually process Stripe refunds yet. To add:

**Update `backend/src/services/stripe.service.ts`:**

```typescript
/**
 * Process refund for cancelled shipment
 */
async processShipmentRefund(
  paymentIntentId: string,
  refundAmount: number,
  reason: string
): Promise<Stripe.Refund> {
  const refund = await stripe.refunds.create({
    payment_intent: paymentIntentId,
    amount: Math.round(refundAmount * 100), // Convert to cents
    reason: 'requested_by_customer',
    metadata: { reason },
  });
  
  return refund;
}

/**
 * Transfer driver compensation
 */
async transferDriverCompensation(
  driverId: string,
  amount: number,
  shipmentId: string
): Promise<Stripe.Transfer> {
  // Get driver's connected Stripe account
  const { data: driverProfile } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('stripe_account_id')
    .eq('id', driverId)
    .single();
  
  if (!driverProfile?.stripe_account_id) {
    throw new Error('Driver does not have a connected Stripe account');
  }
  
  const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
    amount: Math.round(amount * 100),
    currency: 'usd',
    destination: driverProfile.stripe_account_id,
    metadata: {
      shipment_id: shipmentId,
      type: 'cancellation_compensation',
    },
  });
  
  return transfer;
}
```

Then update `PickupVerificationService.cancelAtPickup()` to call these methods.

## 💡 Notes for Phase 3

### Mobile State Management
Consider using React Context or Redux for:
- Active verification state
- Photo upload queue
- Real-time status updates
- Notification management

### Push Notifications
Integrate Expo Notifications for:
- Driver en route alert
- Driver arrived alert
- Verification pending alert
- Client response required (5-min timer)
- Cancellation confirmation

### Photo Optimization
- Compress images before upload (50-70% quality)
- Use Expo ImageManipulator
- Add upload progress indicators
- Implement retry logic
