## Database Schema Corrections Applied

### pickup_verifications Table
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `pickup_location` | GEOGRAPHY(Point,4326) | PostGIS type, shows as `unknown` in TypeScript |
| `verification_status` | TEXT | Not `status` |
| `driver_photos` | JSON | Array of photo objects |
| `distance_from_pickup_meters` | FLOAT | Calculated by backend |

### shipments Table
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `pickup_location` | GEOGRAPHY(Point,4326) | No separate lat/lng columns |
| `pickup_verification_status` | TEXT | Verification result |
| `pickup_verified` | BOOLEAN | True after approval |
| `pickup_verified_at` | TIMESTAMP | Approval timestamp |

### cancellation_records Table
| Column | Type | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `cancelled_by` | UUID | Not `initiated_by` |
| `canceller_role` | TEXT | 'driver' or 'client' |
| `reason_category` | TEXT | Category code |
| `reason_description` | TEXT | Full description |
| `client_refund_amount` | DECIMAL | 70% for at_pickup |
| `driver_compensation_amount` | DECIMAL | 20% for at_pickup |
| `platform_fee_amount` | DECIMAL | 10% for at_pickup |
| `evidence_photos` | JSON | Array of photo URLs |

---

## Key Technical Details

### PostGIS Location Format
```typescript
// Correct format: POINT(longitude latitude)
pickup_location: `POINT(${lng} ${lat})`  // Note: lng FIRST!
```

### JSON Type Handling
```typescript
// Cast Json to specific type
const photos = (verification.driver_photos as unknown as VerificationPhoto[]) || [];
const updated = [...photos, newPhoto];

// Cast back to Json for insert/update
driver_photos: updated as unknown as any
```

### GPS Distance Verification
- **Radius:** 100 meters
- **Formula:** Haversine formula (implemented in backend)
- **Accuracy:** Within 5% of PostGIS ST_Distance

### Refund Calculation (At-Pickup Cancellation)
- **Client Refund:** 70% of original amount
- **Driver Compensation:** 20% of original amount
- **Platform Fee:** 10% of original amount

---

## Testing Workflow

1. **Start Backend**
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Get Auth Token**
   ```http
   POST /api/v1/auth/login
   { "email": "driver@example.com", "password": "test123" }
   ```

3. **Test Full Flow**
   - Mark en-route → Mark arrived → Start verification
   - Upload 4 photos (front, back, left_side, right_side)
   - Submit verification (matches/minor_differences/major_issues)
   - Client response (if minor_differences)
   - Mark picked up (if approved)

4. **Verify Database**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pickup_verifications WHERE shipment_id = '...';
   SELECT * FROM cancellation_records WHERE shipment_id = '...';
   SELECT status, pickup_verified FROM shipments WHERE id = '...';
   ```

See `API_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` for complete testing guide!

5. `initiated_by` → `cancelled_by` (1 occurrence)
6. Added `canceller_role` field
7. `reason` → `reason_category` + `reason_description`
8. Fixed refund field names (3 fields)

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables
```env
# Backend
DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_role_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=3000

# Supabase Storage
STORAGE_BUCKET=shipment-photos
```

### Database Migration
```sql
-- Already applied in Phase 1
-- Tables: pickup_verifications, cancellation_records
-- Functions: calculate_cancellation_refund, update_shipment_status_safe
-- Triggers: process_verification, handle_cancellation
-- RLS: Enabled on all tables
```

### API Security
- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ Authorization checks per endpoint
- ✅ RLS policies enforce data access
- ✅ Input validation middleware
- ✅ Error handling with proper status codes

### Performance Considerations
- ✅ PostGIS spatial indexes on location columns
- ✅ Database indexes on foreign keys
- ✅ Efficient query patterns (single queries where possible)
- ✅ Photo upload to Supabase Storage (not database)

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Column 'verification_location' does not exist"  
**Solution:** Use `pickup_location` instead

**Issue:** "Property 'status' does not exist in type..."  
**Solution:** Use `verification_status` for pickup_verifications table

**Issue:** PostGIS location not storing correctly  
**Solution:** Ensure format is `POINT(longitude latitude)` - longitude first!

**Issue:** Photo upload fails  
**Solution:** Check Supabase Storage bucket exists and is public

**Issue:** GPS distance calculation inaccurate  
**Solution:** Backend uses Haversine formula, accurate within 5% at these distances
