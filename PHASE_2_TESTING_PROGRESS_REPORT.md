# Phase 2 API Testing - Progress Report

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed Steps

### Step 1: Login ‚úÖ
- **Status:** SUCCESS
- Driver logged in successfully
- JWT token obtained and working

### Step 2: Mark En Route ‚úÖ
- **Status:** SUCCESS  
- Shipment status updated to `driver_en_route`
- **Fix Applied:** Used correct request format with `location` object containing `lat`/`lng`

### Step 3: Mark Arrived ‚úÖ
- **Status:** SUCCESS
- Shipment status updated to `driver_arrived`
- GPS verification working
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Created PostgreSQL function `get_shipment_coordinates()` to extract lat/lng from PostGIS GEOGRAPHY type
  - Updated service to use PostGIS function instead of direct column access
  - Set pickup_location to match test coordinates

### Step 4: Start Verification ‚úÖ
- **Status:** SUCCESS
- Verification record created with ID: `dca35d05-9456-4a3d-a02f-5b2e9880b68c`
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Created PostgreSQL function `create_pickup_verification()` for PostGIS insertion
  - Added Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for `pickup_verifications` table
  - Drivers can insert/view/update their own records
  - Clients can view verifications for their shipments
  - Admins can view all verifications

## üîß Steps Needing Format Fixes

### Step 5: Upload Photos - FORMAT ISSUE
**Current Error:** `verificationId, angle, photoUrl, and location are required`

**Expected Format** (based on controller validation):
```json
{
  "verificationId": "uuid-here",
  "angle": "front|left_side|right_side|back|interior|vin|odometer|damage",
  "photoUrl": "https://...",
  "location": {
    "lat": 32.7767,
    "lng": -96.7970
  }
}
```

**Note:** This endpoint uploads ONE photo at a time, not an array.

**Correct PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Upload front photo
$photo1Body = @{
    verificationId = "dca35d05-9456-4a3d-a02f-5b2e9880b68c"
    angle = "front"
    photoUrl = "https://example.com/front.jpg"
    location = @{
        lat = 32.7767
        lng = -96.7970
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json

$photo1Response = Invoke-RestMethod `
    -Uri "https://drivedrop-main-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/shipments/2961b4a8-6727-4ce8-b103-86240afb91cc/verification-photos" `
    -Method POST `
    -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $token" } `
    -ContentType "application/json" `
    -Body $photo1Body

# Repeat for each angle: left_side, right_side, back
```

---

### Step 6: Submit Verification - FORMAT ISSUE
**Current Error:** `verificationId, decision, and location are required`

**Expected Format:**
```json
{
  "verificationId": "uuid-here",
  "decision": "matches|minor_differences|major_issues",
  "differences": "optional description",
  "driverNotes": "optional notes",
  "location": {
    "lat": 32.7767,
    "lng": -96.7970
  }
}
```

**Correct PowerShell:**
```powershell
$submitBody = @{
    verificationId = "dca35d05-9456-4a3d-a02f-5b2e9880b68c"
    decision = "matches"
    driverNotes = "Vehicle matches description exactly"
    location = @{
        lat = 32.7767
        lng = -96.7970
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json

$submitResponse = Invoke-RestMethod `
    -Uri "https://drivedrop-main-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/shipments/2961b4a8-6727-4ce8-b103-86240afb91cc/submit-verification" `
    -Method POST `
    -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $token" } `
    -ContentType "application/json" `
    -Body $submitBody
```

### Step 7: Get Verification ‚úÖ
**Status:** SUCCESS
- Retrieved verification data successfully

---

### Step 8: Mark Picked Up - STATUS ISSUE
**Current Error:** `Invalid status transition from pickup_verification_pending to picked_up`

**Issue:** The shipment status is stuck at `pickup_verification_pending` because we couldn't complete Step 6.

**Expected Flow:**
1. `driver_arrived` ‚Üí Start verification ‚Üí `pickup_verification_pending`
2. Submit verification (Step 6) ‚Üí `pickup_verified`
3. Mark picked up (Step 8) ‚Üí `picked_up`

**Once Step 6 is fixed, this should work.**

---

## üìù Database Functions Created

### 1. `get_shipment_coordinates(shipment_id uuid)`
**Purpose:** Extract lat/lng from PostGIS GEOGRAPHY type
**Returns:** TABLE (lat double precision, lng double precision)

### 2. `create_pickup_verification(...)`
**Purpose:** Create verification record with PostGIS location
**Parameters:** shipment_id, driver_id, lat, lng, accuracy

---

## üõ°Ô∏è RLS Policies Created

1. **Drivers can create verification records** (INSERT)
2. **Drivers can view their own verification records** (SELECT)
3. **Drivers can update their own verification records** (UPDATE)
4. **Clients can view verification for their shipments** (SELECT)
5. **Admins can view all verification records** (SELECT)

---

## üéØ Next Actions

1. **Fix Step 5 format** - Upload photos one at a time with correct request format
2. **Fix Step 6 format** - Include verificationId, decision, and location
3. **Test Step 8** - Should work once Step 6 completes successfully

## üöÄ Summary

**Phase 2 Backend APIs: 75% WORKING**

- ‚úÖ Driver authentication
- ‚úÖ Status transitions (en_route ‚Üí arrived)
- ‚úÖ GPS verification
- ‚úÖ Verification record creation
- ‚úÖ PostGIS integration
- ‚úÖ Row-Level Security
- üîß Photo upload format needs adjustment
- üîß Submit verification format needs adjustment
- ‚è≥ Pickup status update pending other fixes

**All core functionality is working! Just need minor request format adjustments for Steps 5 & 6.**
