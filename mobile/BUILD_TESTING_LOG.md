# Build Testing Log

## Build v52 (BASELINE)
**Commit**: `08f5868` - Exact working state from Sept 12
**Changes**: NONE - Pure reproduction
**Dependencies**: NO Stripe, NO image-manipulator
**Status**: Building...
**Expected**: 58MB AAB, should work perfectly ✅

---

## Test Plan After v52

If v52 works (58MB):
→ **Proves**: EAS can still build working apps from this code

### Build v53: Add ONLY Stripe
**Changes from v52**:
1. Add to package.json: `"@stripe/stripe-react-native": "0.37.3"`
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Build

**Expected**: If this crashes → Stripe is the problem
**If works**: Stripe is NOT the problem, test image-manipulator next

### Build v54: Add ONLY image-manipulator
**Changes from v52**:
1. Add to package.json: `"expo-image-manipulator": "~13.0.5"`
2. Run `yarn install` 
3. Build

**Expected**: If this crashes → image-manipulator is the problem
**If works**: image-manipulator is NOT the problem

### Build v55: Add BOTH dependencies
**Changes from v52**:
1. Add both Stripe + image-manipulator to package.json
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Build

**Expected**: If this crashes but v53/v54 worked → Interaction between them
**If works**: Dependencies are fine, problem is in CODE changes

### Build v56: Add FormData Polyfill
**Changes from v55**:
1. Create `formDataPolyfill.js` (copy from main branch)
2. Update `index.ts` to import it
3. Build

**Expected**: If this crashes → Polyfill is the problem
**If works**: Polyfill is fine

### Build v57: Full Current State
**Changes**: Checkout `main` branch
**Expected**: Should crash (as we know it does)
**Purpose**: Confirm we're testing the right thing

---

## If All Dependency Tests Pass

Then the problem is in:
1. Android gradle configuration changes
2. Kotlin version changes
3. App.tsx changes
4. Some other code modification

We'll need to do **binary search** through commits:
- Test commit at 25% point
- Test commit at 50% point  
- Test commit at 75% point
- Narrow down to exact breaking commit

## Build Results

### v52: **BASELINE - Exact Working Commit** ✅ WORKING!
- AAB Size: **55.4 MB** ✅ (Same as original working 58MB)
- APK Size: **83.5 MB** ✅ (Good size, not 189MB)
- JS Bundle: 3.58MB
- Build ID: cd702352-e6e2-477a-b709-bb59f089233f  
- Commit: 08f5868
- Status: **✅ WORKS PERFECTLY** - App launches, navigates, no crashes
- Notes: This is the exact reproduction of Sept 12 working commit. NO Stripe, NO image-manipulator, NO polyfills.
- **Conclusion**: EAS environment is fine. Problem is in changes made AFTER this commit.

### v53: **Test Stripe Alone** ❌ **BUILD FAILED - STRIPE IS THE PROBLEM!**
- Status: ❌ **FAILED - Kotlin compilation error**
- Changes from v52: Added ONLY `@stripe/stripe-react-native: 0.37.3`
- Error: `Type argument is not within its bounds: should be subtype of 'android.view.View'`
- Root Cause: **Stripe SDK 0.37.3 incompatible with Kotlin 2.0.21**
- Files: GooglePayButtonManager.kt, AddToWalletButtonManager.kt
- **CONCLUSION: STRIPE SDK IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL CRASHES!**

### v54: **STRIPE VERSION FIX** ✅ SUCCESS!
- AAB Size: **63.8 MB** ✅ (Back to healthy range!)
- APK Size: **92.9 MB** ✅ (Good size, not 189MB)
- Stripe Version: **0.42.0** (downgraded from 0.37.3)
- Status: **✅ WORKS PERFECTLY** - App launches, navigates, no crashes!
- **ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED**: Stripe SDK version compatibility with Kotlin 2.0.21
- **SOLUTION**: Use Stripe SDK 0.42.0 instead of 0.37.3 or 0.54.1

### v55: **ADD EXPO-IMAGE-MANIPULATOR** ✅ SUCCESS!
- AAB Size: **66.9 MB** ✅ (Still healthy!)
- APK Size: **93.0 MB** ✅ (Good size)
- Changes: Added `expo-image-manipulator: ~13.0.5` + Stripe 0.42.0
- Status: **✅ WORKS PERFECTLY** - App launches, navigates, no crashes!
- **CONCLUSION**: Both dependencies work together without conflicts!
