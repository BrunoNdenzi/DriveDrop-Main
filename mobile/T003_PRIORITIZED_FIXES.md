## Systematic Fix Approach

For each file, we'll apply the following strategy:

1. **Lint Analysis**: Run ESLint specifically on the file
2. **TypeScript Check**: Validate TypeScript types
3. **Code Splitting**: Identify opportunities to break down large components
4. **Fix Implementation**: Apply fixes one file at a time with focused commits
5. **Testing**: Verify functionality after fixes

## Common Issues to Address

Based on our analysis, common issues include:

- **Type annotations**: Missing or improper TypeScript types
- **Component size**: Overly large React components
- **Import structure**: Excessive or improperly structured imports
- **Navigation typing**: Improper navigation prop typing

## Next Steps

1. Select one file from the list above to begin fixing
2. Run ESLint specifically on that file to identify issues
3. Fix issues with a focused commit
4. Move to the next file in priority order

## Fix Implementation Guidelines

1. **Keep commits focused**: One file at a time
2. **Document changes**: Maintain a log of fixes applied
3. **Verify functionality**: Ensure no regression
4. **Consistent patterns**: Apply consistent fixes across files

Let's systematically improve the codebase by addressing these files in order of priority.
