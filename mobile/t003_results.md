# T003 Script Execution Results

## Context

We attempted to run a comprehensive analysis script to collect lint and type issues across the codebase, but encountered several technical challenges:

1. ESLint configuration issues
2. TypeScript compiler recognition in the shell
3. JSON encoding problems
4. .eslintignore compatibility warnings

## Successful Approach

We ultimately created a simplified analysis script `t003_mobile_analysis.ps1` which:

1. Successfully analyzed all TypeScript/JavaScript files in the mobile app
2. Calculated a "complexity score" based on line count and import count
3. Generated a prioritized list of files to fix
4. Captured sample code from the top files

## Key Findings

The analysis identified several extremely large files (700-900 lines) that need refactoring, with most complexity concentrated in screen components:

- Admin screens: AdminAssignmentScreen, AdminDashboardScreen
- Driver screens: DriverProfileScreen, MyShipmentsScreen, MessagesScreen, JobDetailsScreen
- Navigation: navigation/index.tsx has 40 imports, suggesting a central point for refactoring

## Output Files

We've created:

1. `mobile/T003_PRIORITIZED_FIXES.md` - Strategic plan for systematic fixes
2. `%TEMP%\drivedrop_mobile_analysis\run.log` - Detailed analysis log
3. `%TEMP%\drivedrop_mobile_analysis\top_files.json` - Machine-readable prioritized file list

## Next Steps

1. Select the highest priority file (AdminAssignmentScreen.tsx)
2. Run focused lint and type checks on that file
3. Apply fixes with a specific commit
4. Continue with the next file

This approach allows for systematic improvement of the codebase with clear traceability and focused commits.
