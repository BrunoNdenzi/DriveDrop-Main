# Bind Error Deep Analysis - October 5, 2025

## The Problem

**Error:** `Cannot read property 'bind' of undefined`  
**Location:** `index.android.bundle:1:1063324`

## What's Actually Happening

The error message "Cannot read property 'bind' of undefined" means:

```javascript
// Something like this is happening in the bundle:
someObject.someMethod.bind(context)
// Where someObject.someMethod is undefined
```

This is **NOT** the same as:
```javascript
undefined.bind() // This we CAN catch with Function.prototype.bind wrapper
```

## Why Our First Fix Didn't Work

Our `Function.prototype.bind` wrapper only catches when `.bind()` is called directly on `undefined`:

```javascript
Function.prototype.bind = function() {
  if (this === undefined || this === null) {
    // This only runs if: undefined.bind()
    // NOT if: obj.prop.bind() where obj.prop is undefined
  }
};
```

The actual error is happening **before** `.bind()` is even accessed - it's trying to read the `bind` property of an `undefined` value.

## The Real Solution

We need to catch this at the **error handler level**, not the function level:

```javascript
global.ErrorUtils.setGlobalHandler(function(error, isFatal) {
  if (error.message.includes("Cannot read property 'bind' of undefined")) {
    // Catch it here and prevent fatal crash
    console.error('Caught bind error, continuing...');
    return; // Don't crash
  }
  // Handle other errors normally
});
```

## Why This Happens

Looking at the stack trace, the error originates from:
- Bundle address: `1:1063324`
- During module loading: `loadModuleImplementation`
- Multiple nested `metroRequire` calls

This suggests a **third-party library** or native module is trying to bind a method that doesn't exist in the React Native environment.

## Possible Culprits

Based on our dependencies:
1. **Supabase** - Already required FormData polyfill
2. **Stripe** - May be accessing native APIs
3. **React Native libraries** - Could be expecting browser APIs
4. **Sentry** - Error tracking library (if still installed)

## Build v37 Strategy

Instead of trying to prevent the error, we're **catching and recovering** from it:

1. ✅ Install global error handler
2. ✅ Detect "bind" errors specifically
3. ✅ Log the error for debugging
4. ✅ Mark as non-fatal to allow app to continue
5. ✅ Let other errors crash normally

## Expected Outcome

With v37, we expect:
- ❌ Error still occurs
- ✅ Error is logged but not fatal
- ✅ App continues initialization
- ✅ App reaches login screen
- ⚠️ Possible feature degradation (whatever was trying to bind may not work)

## Next Steps If This Works

1. Identify exactly which library is causing the error (from logs)
2. Find the specific missing API or method
3. Create a targeted polyfill for that specific API
4. Replace global handler with proper fix

## Next Steps If This Doesn't Work

The error might be too early in the bundle loading process, before ErrorUtils is available. In that case, we need to:

1. Analyze the bundle to find the exact code at address `1:1063324`
2. Identify the library causing the issue
3. Either:
   - Remove/replace the library
   - Downgrade to a compatible version
   - Create a more aggressive polyfill

## Build Details
