# v41 - Testing Theory: React Native Maps is the Culprit

## Build Information
- **Build ID:** 043e3d29-5c24-4fca-bc3f-0c8c372250ca
- **Version:** v41
- **Key Change:** Temporarily disabled react-native-maps (RouteMapScreen)

## Theory
Based on user information:
> "The app was working well, but once I implemented messaging and maps features, that's when all this started."

The bind error at `bundle:1:1063887` is likely caused by **react-native-maps** trying to access native module methods that don't exist or aren't properly initialized.

## What Was Changed

### Files Modified:
1. **`mobile/src/navigation/index.tsx`**
   - Commented out `import RouteMapScreen`
   - Commented out the `RouteMap` route in the navigator

### What This Tests:
- If the app launches successfully WITHOUT the bind error
- Confirms react-native-maps is the root cause
- Other features (messaging, shipments, etc.) should still work

## Expected Outcomes

### ✅ SUCCESS (App works):
**Confirms:** react-native-maps is causing the bind error

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix react-native-maps integration properly
2. Options:
   - Re-link the native module correctly
   - Update react-native-maps to compatible version
   - Use lazy loading for map screen
   - Add proper native module initialization
   - Create a proper polyfill for missing map native methods

### ❌ FAILURE (App still crashes):
**Means:** The bind error is NOT from react-native-maps

**Next Steps:**
1. The issue is from something else (messaging features?)
2. Need to investigate other recently added dependencies
3. Check if it's from `react-native-google-places-autocomplete`

## If Successful - Proper Fix for Maps

Once we confirm maps is the issue, we can implement a proper fix:

### Option 1: Lazy Load Map Screen
```typescript
const RouteMapScreen = React.lazy(() => import('../screens/driver/RouteMapScreen'));
```

### Option 2: Conditional Import
```typescript
let RouteMapScreen;
try {
  RouteMapScreen = require('../screens/driver/RouteMapScreen').default;
} catch (e) {
  console.warn('Maps module failed to load:', e);
  RouteMapScreen = () => <Text>Map not available</Text>;
}
```

### Option 3: Update/Fix react-native-maps
```bash
# Remove and reinstall
yarn remove react-native-maps
yarn add react-native-maps@1.20.1

# Clear and rebuild
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
```

### Option 4: Ensure Proper Linking
```bash
# For Expo managed workflow
expo install react-native-maps
eas build --platform android --clear-cache
```

## Timeline
- **Oct 5, 2025 - 20:15** - v41 build started (maps disabled)
- **ETA:** ~20 minutes

*This is a critical test to isolate the root cause.*
