/**
 * Manual Test Instructions
 * 
 * To manually test the complete integration:
 * 
 * 1. CLIENT SIDE:
 *    - Open the app as a client
 *    - Navigate to NewShipmentScreen
 *    - Fill out shipment details
 *    - Complete booking flow
 *    - Verify BookingConfirmationScreen shows success
 * 
 * 2. DRIVER SIDE:
 *    - Open the app as a driver
 *    - Navigate to DriverDashboardScreen
 *    - Verify new shipment appears in "Available Jobs"
 *    - Click "Quick Apply" on the shipment
 *    - Verify success message appears
 * 
 * 3. DATABASE VERIFICATION:
 *    - Check Supabase dashboard
 *    - Verify shipment record in 'shipments' table
 *    - Verify application record in 'shipment_applications' table
 *    - Verify status transitions work correctly
