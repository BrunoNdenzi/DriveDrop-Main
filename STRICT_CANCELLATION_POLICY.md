# 🔒 STRICT CANCELLATION POLICY - Implementation Summary

## Policy Overview

**STRICT RULE:** Shipments can **ONLY** be cancelled while in `pending` status **AND** no driver has been assigned.

Once a driver is assigned to a shipment, cancellation **MUST** go through customer support.

---

## ✅ What Changed

### Previous Policy (Too Lenient)
- ❌ Allowed cancellation from pending/accepted/assigned statuses
- ❌ Allowed cancellation even after driver assignment
- ❌ Multiple refund scenarios based on deadlines

### New Policy (Strict - Protects Drivers)
- ✅ **ONLY** pending shipments with `driver_id = NULL` can be cancelled
- ✅ 100% refund for qualifying cancellations
- ✅ All other cases require support intervention
- ✅ Protects driver commitments once they accept

---

## 📋 Cancellation Matrix

| Status | Driver ID | Can Cancel? | Refund | Action |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **pending** | `NULL` | ✅ **YES** | 💰 **100%** | ✅ Automatic cancellation |
| **pending** | Not NULL | ❌ NO | N/A | 📞 Contact Support |
| **accepted** | Not NULL | ❌ NO | N/A | 📞 Contact Support |
| **assigned** | Not NULL | ❌ NO | N/A | 📞 Contact Support |
| **in_transit** | Not NULL | ❌ NO | N/A | 📞 Contact Support |
| **picked_up** | Not NULL | ❌ NO | N/A | 📞 Contact Support |
| **delivered** | Not NULL | ❌ NO | N/A | 📞 Contact Support |
| **cancelled** | Any | ❌ NO | N/A | Already cancelled |

**Bottom Line:** Only the narrow window between payment and driver assignment allows self-service cancellation.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Policy (`sql/fix_shipment_cancellation.sql`)

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Clients can update their own shipments"
  ON shipments
  FOR UPDATE
  TO public
  USING (auth.uid() = client_id)
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = client_id
    AND (
      -- ✅ Allow cancellation ONLY from pending with no driver
      (
        NEW.status = 'cancelled'::shipment_status 
        AND OLD.status = 'pending'::shipment_status
        AND OLD.driver_id IS NULL  -- CRITICAL: No driver assigned
      )
      -- ✅ Allow other updates when pending
      OR (
        OLD.status = 'pending'::shipment_status 
        AND NEW.status = 'pending'::shipment_status
      )
    )
  );
```

### 2. Refund Trigger Logic

```sql
-- In handle_shipment_cancellation() function
CASE OLD.status
  WHEN 'pending' THEN
    IF OLD.driver_id IS NULL THEN
      -- ✅ Full refund for pending with no driver
      v_refund_eligible := true;
      v_refund_amount := v_payment_record.amount;
    ELSE
      -- ❌ Driver assigned = no refund
      v_refund_eligible := false;
      v_refund_amount := 0;
    END IF;
  ELSE
    -- ❌ All other statuses = no refund
    v_refund_eligible := false;
    v_refund_amount := 0;
END CASE;
```

### 3. Eligibility Check Function

```sql
-- check_cancellation_eligibility() returns:
IF v_shipment.status = 'pending' AND v_shipment.driver_id IS NULL THEN
  -- ✅ Eligible
  RETURN jsonb_build_object(
    'eligible', true,
    'refund_eligible', true,
    'refund_amount', payment_amount,
    'refund_percentage', 100,
    'message', 'Free cancellation - Full refund will be processed'
  );
ELSE
  -- ❌ Not eligible
  RETURN jsonb_build_object(
    'eligible', false,
    'reason', 'Can only cancel pending shipments before driver assignment. 
               Please contact support for assistance.'
  );
END IF;
```

### 4. Mobile App UI (`mobile/src/screens/shipments/ShipmentDetailsScreen.tsx`)

**Cancel Button Visibility:**
```tsx
{/* Only show for pending shipments with no driver */}
{shipment.status === 'pending' && !shipment.driver_id && (
  <View style={styles.actionsContainer}>
    <TouchableOpacity
      style={styles.cancelButton}
      onPress={handleCancelShipment}
    >
      <Text style={styles.cancelButtonText}>Cancel Shipment</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  </View>
)}
```

**Cancel Handler:**
```tsx
async function handleCancelShipment() {
  // 1. Check eligibility
  const { data: eligibilityData } = await supabase
    .rpc('check_cancellation_eligibility', { p_shipment_id: shipmentId });
  
  const eligibility = eligibilityData as CancellationEligibility;
  
  // 2. If not eligible, show support message
  if (!eligibility?.eligible) {
    Alert.alert(
      'Cannot Cancel',
      eligibility?.reason || 'Please contact support for assistance.'
    );
    return;
  }
  
  // 3. Show refund info (only for pending with no driver)
  Alert.alert(
    'Cancel Shipment',
    `Are you sure?\n\n💰 Refund: $${amount} (100%)`,
    [
      { text: 'No, Keep Shipment', style: 'cancel' },
      { text: 'Yes, Cancel', onPress: async () => { /* cancel */ } }
    ]
  );
}
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### Scenario 1: Early Cancellation (Allowed) ✅

```
User creates shipment → Pays → No driver yet
         ↓
Opens shipment details
         ↓
Sees "Cancel Shipment" button
         ↓
Taps button
         ↓
System checks: status=pending, driver_id=NULL ✅
         ↓
Shows dialog:
"Cancel Shipment

Are you sure you want to cancel this shipment?

💰 Refund: $15.00 (100%)
Free cancellation - Full refund will be processed

[No, Keep Shipment] [Yes, Cancel]"
         ↓
User confirms
         ↓
Shipment cancelled, refund processed automatically
         ↓
Success: "Your shipment has been cancelled and a refund of $15.00 
          will be processed within 5-10 business days."
```

### Scenario 2: Driver Assigned (Blocked) ❌

```
User creates shipment → Pays → Driver accepts
         ↓
Opens shipment details
         ↓
NO "Cancel Shipment" button shown
         ↓
User tries to cancel (if button was there)
         ↓
System checks: driver_id IS NOT NULL ❌
         ↓
Shows dialog:
"Cannot Cancel

Cannot cancel after driver assignment. 
Please contact support for assistance.

[OK]"
         ↓
No cancellation, user must contact support
```

## 🔐 Security & Business Logic

### Why This Policy?

1. **Protects Driver Commitments**
   - Once a driver accepts, they've committed time
   - They may have declined other opportunities
   - Driver trust and engagement depends on commitment protection

2. **Reduces Abuse**
   - Prevents last-minute cancellations after driver investment
   - Clear boundary for automatic vs. manual handling
   - Reduces support burden from fraudulent cancellations

3. **Fair Refund Policy**
   - 100% refund before driver assignment = fair to client
   - No refund after assignment = fair to driver
   - Clear policy = no disputes

### Database-Level Protection

```sql
-- RLS Policy ensures:
✅ Only client can cancel their own shipment
✅ Only pending status can transition to cancelled
✅ Only when driver_id IS NULL
✅ No SQL injection possible
✅ No bypass through API or direct DB access
```

### Application-Level Protection

```tsx
// UI prevents invalid actions:
✅ Button only shows when eligible
✅ Eligibility checked before showing dialog
✅ Clear error messages when not eligible
✅ Support contact info provided when needed
```

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

```sql
-- Cancellation rate by timing
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE driver_id IS NULL) as before_driver_assignment,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE driver_id IS NOT NULL) as after_driver_assignment
FROM shipment_cancellations
WHERE cancelled_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Average time to driver assignment
SELECT 
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (
    SELECT created_at FROM shipment_status_history 
    WHERE shipment_id = s.id AND status = 'accepted' 
    LIMIT 1
  ) - s.created_at) / 60) as avg_minutes_to_assignment
FROM shipments s
WHERE driver_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Cancellation window analysis
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_cancellations,
  AVG(refund_amount) / 100 as avg_refund_dollars,
  SUM(refund_amount) / 100 as total_refund_dollars
FROM shipment_cancellations
WHERE refund_status = 'completed'
  AND cancelled_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **1. Run SQL Migration**
  ```bash
  # In Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
  # Paste contents of: sql/fix_shipment_cancellation.sql
  # Click "Run"
  ```

- [ ] **2. Verify Database Changes**
  ```sql
  -- Check policy
  SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
  WHERE policyname = 'Clients can update their own shipments';
  
  -- Check function
  SELECT check_cancellation_eligibility('<test-shipment-id>');
  ```

- [ ] **3. Reload Mobile App**
  ```bash
  # Reload Expo Go to get updated code
  ```

- [ ] **4. Test Scenarios**
  - [ ] Create shipment, cancel before driver (should work)
  - [ ] Create shipment, have driver accept, try to cancel (should fail)
  - [ ] Verify button hides after driver assignment
  - [ ] Verify refund amount shown correctly
  - [ ] Verify error messages clear and helpful

- [ ] **5. Update Support Documentation**
  - [ ] Add process for handling post-assignment cancellations
  - [ ] Train support team on new policy
  - [ ] Create refund authorization process

## 📞 Support Process

When users need to cancel after driver assignment:

1. **Contact Support** (email/phone/chat)
2. **Support verifies:**
   - Shipment details
   - User identity
   - Driver status (accepted, picked up, in transit, etc.)
3. **Support decides:**
   - Full refund (exceptional circumstances)
   - Partial refund (based on driver progress)
   - No refund (driver already invested significant time)
4. **Support manually:**
   - Updates shipment status
   - Processes refund through Stripe
   - Records in cancellation_cancellations table
   - Notifies driver if needed
