## üõ£Ô∏è API Endpoints to Create

### 1. Driver Status Updates

#### **POST /api/shipments/:id/driver-en-route**

**Purpose:** Mark driver as en route to pickup location

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  shipment: {
    id: string;
    status: 'driver_en_route';
    updated_at: string;
  }
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Verify authenticated user is the assigned driver
2. Verify current status is 'accepted'
3. Call `update_shipment_status_safe('driver_en_route')`
4. Send push notification to client with ETA
5. Return updated shipment

**Notifications:**
- Client: "Your driver is on the way! ETA: X minutes"

---

#### **POST /api/shipments/:id/driver-arrived**

**Purpose:** Mark driver as arrived at pickup (GPS verified)

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
    accuracy: number;  // meters
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  shipment: {
    id: string;
    status: 'driver_arrived';
    driver_arrival_time: string;
  }
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Verify authenticated user is the assigned driver
2. Verify current status is 'driver_en_route'
3. Get shipment pickup coordinates (pickup_lat, pickup_lng)
4. Calculate distance using Haversine formula
5. **ENFORCE:** Distance must be ‚â§100 meters
6. If > 100m, return error: "You must be within 100 meters of pickup location. Current distance: Xm"
7. Call `update_shipment_status_safe('driver_arrived')`
8. Update `driver_arrival_time` to NOW()
9. Send push notification to client
10. Return updated shipment

**Error Handling:**
```typescript
if (distance > 100) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: 'GPS_VERIFICATION_FAILED',
    message: `You must be within 100 meters of pickup location. Current distance: ${Math.round(distance)}m`,
    distance: distance,
    requiredDistance: 100
  }
}
```

**Notifications:**
- Client: "Your driver has arrived at the pickup location"
- Driver: "You may now start the pickup verification"

---

### 2. Pickup Verification Workflow

#### **POST /api/shipments/:id/start-verification**

**Purpose:** Initialize pickup verification process

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
    accuracy: number;
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  verification: {
    id: string;
    shipment_id: string;
    driver_id: string;
    status: 'pending';
    photo_count: 0;
    required_photos: ['front', 'rear', 'driver_side', 'passenger_side', 'front_driver_quarter', 'front_passenger_quarter'];
    created_at: string;
  }
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Verify authenticated user is the assigned driver
2. Verify current status is 'driver_arrived'
3. Call `update_shipment_status_safe('pickup_verification_pending')`
4. Insert into `pickup_verifications` table:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO pickup_verifications (
     shipment_id,
     driver_id,
     verification_location,
     status
   ) VALUES (...)
   ```
5. Return verification record
6. Send push notification to client

**Notifications:**
- Client: "Driver is verifying vehicle condition..."

---

#### **POST /api/shipments/:id/verification-photos**

**Purpose:** Upload verification photo

**Request:** Multipart form data
```typescript
{
  verificationId: string;
  angle: PhotoAngle;  // 'front', 'rear', etc.
  photo: File;  // Image file
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  photo: {
    id: string;
    url: string;  // Public URL
    angle: 'front';
    timestamp: string;
    location: { lat, lng };
  },
  verification: {
    id: string;
    photo_count: number;
    photos_remaining: ['rear', 'driver_side', ...];
  }
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Verify authenticated user is the driver for this verification
2. Validate image (size <5MB, type: jpg/png)
3. Generate unique filename: `{verificationId}/{angle}_{timestamp}.jpg`
4. Upload to Supabase Storage:
   ```typescript
   const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
     .from('shipment-photos')
     .upload(`pickup-verifications/${filename}`, fileBuffer, {
       contentType: 'image/jpeg',
       upsert: false
     });
   ```
5. Get public URL
6. Update `pickup_verifications.driver_photos` JSONB array:
   ```typescript
   const photoData = {
     id: generateId(),
     url: publicUrl,
     angle: angle,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
     location: { lat, lng }
   };
   
   UPDATE pickup_verifications
   SET driver_photos = driver_photos || jsonb_build_array(photoData),
       photo_count = photo_count + 1
   WHERE id = verificationId;
   ```
7. Return photo data and updated verification
8. If photo_count >= 6, allow submission

**Error Handling:**
- Image too large: "Photo must be under 5MB"
- Invalid angle: "Photo angle must be one of: front, rear, ..."
- Duplicate angle: "Photo for {angle} already uploaded. Delete first to replace."
- Upload failed: "Failed to upload photo. Please try again."

---

#### **POST /api/shipments/:id/submit-verification**

**Purpose:** Submit completed verification with decision

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  verificationId: string;
  decision: 'matches' | 'minor_differences' | 'major_issues';
  differences?: [
    {
      type: 'new_damage' | 'missing_item' | ...;
      severity: 'minor' | 'major';
      description: string;
      affectedArea: string;
      driverPhoto?: string;  // URL
      clientPhoto?: string;  // URL
    }
  ];
  driverNotes?: string;
  location: { lat, lng };
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  verification: {
    id: string;
    decision: 'matches';
    status: 'approved_by_client';
    verification_completed_at: string;
  },
  shipment: {
    id: string;
    status: 'pickup_verified';  // or 'cancelled' if major issues
  },
  nextAction: 'mark_picked_up' | 'wait_for_client' | 'cancelled';
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Verify authenticated user is the driver
2. Verify photo_count >= 6
3. Calculate distance from pickup
4. Update verification record:
   ```sql
   UPDATE pickup_verifications
   SET decision = p_decision,
       differences = p_differences,
       driver_notes = p_driver_notes,
       distance_from_pickup_meters = p_distance,
       verification_completed_at = NOW()
   WHERE id = verificationId;
   ```
5. **Handle decision:**

   **A. If decision = 'matches':**
   - Call `update_shipment_status_safe('pickup_verified')`
   - Update `pickup_verified = TRUE`, `pickup_verified_at = NOW()`
   - Set `verification.status = 'approved_by_client'`
   - Return `nextAction: 'mark_picked_up'`
   - Send notification: "‚úÖ Vehicle verified! Driver is loading."

   **B. If decision = 'minor_differences':**
   - Keep status as 'pickup_verification_pending'
   - Set `verification.status = 'pending'`
   - Send push notification to client with photos
   - Send SMS to client (high priority)
   - Start 5-minute timer
   - Return `nextAction: 'wait_for_client'`
   - Notification: "‚ö†Ô∏è Your driver noticed minor differences. Please review within 5 minutes."

   **C. If decision = 'major_issues':**
   - Call cancellation endpoint internally
   - Create cancellation record (type: at_pickup_mismatch)
   - Calculate refund (70% client, 20% driver, 10% platform)
   - Process Stripe refund
   - Update shipment status to 'cancelled'
   - Return `nextAction: 'cancelled'`
   - Notification: "‚ùå Shipment cancelled due to major vehicle issues. Refund: $X"

6. Return verification and shipment data

**Error Handling:**
- Photo count < 6: "Minimum 6 photos required"
- Invalid decision: "Decision must be: matches, minor_differences, or major_issues"
- No differences provided for minor/major: "Differences required when issues found"

---

#### **POST /api/shipments/:id/client-response**

**Purpose:** Client approves or disputes minor differences

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  verificationId: string;
  response: 'approved' | 'disputed';
  notes?: string;
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  verification: {
    id: string;
    client_response: 'approved';
    client_responded_at: string;
    status: 'approved_by_client';
  },
  shipment: {
    id: string;
    status: 'pickup_verified';  // or 'cancelled' if disputed
  }
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Verify authenticated user is the client (shipment.client_id)
2. Verify verification exists and has minor_differences
3. Update verification:
   ```sql
   UPDATE pickup_verifications
   SET client_response = p_response,
       client_notes = p_notes,
       client_responded_at = NOW(),
       status = CASE 
         WHEN p_response = 'approved' THEN 'approved_by_client'
         ELSE 'disputed_by_client'
       END
   WHERE id = verificationId;
   ```
4. **If approved:**
   - Call `update_shipment_status_safe('pickup_verified')`
   - Update shipment pickup_verified fields
   - Notification to driver: "Client approved pickup. Proceed with loading."
   
5. **If disputed:**
   - Call cancellation endpoint
   - Create cancellation record (type: at_pickup_mismatch)
   - Calculate refund (70% client, 20% driver, 10% platform)
   - Process Stripe refund
   - Update shipment status to 'cancelled'
   - Notification to driver: "Client disputed verification. Shipment cancelled."

6. Return updated verification and shipment

**5-Minute Timer Logic:**
- If client doesn't respond within 5 minutes, auto-approve
- Implement via cron job or scheduled function:
  ```sql
  -- Find pending responses > 5 minutes
  SELECT * FROM pickup_verifications
  WHERE status = 'pending'
    AND decision = 'minor_differences'
    AND verification_completed_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
    AND client_response IS NULL;
  
  -- Auto-approve them
  UPDATE pickup_verifications
  SET client_response = 'approved',
      status = 'approved_by_client',
      client_notes = 'Auto-approved - no response within 5 minutes'
  WHERE id IN (above query);
  ```

**Notifications:**
- Driver (approved): "‚úÖ Client approved pickup. Load vehicle."
- Driver (disputed): "‚ùå Client disputed. Shipment cancelled. Compensation: $X"

---

#### **POST /api/shipments/:id/cancel-at-pickup**

**Purpose:** Cancel shipment at pickup (mismatch or fraud)

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  cancellationType: 'at_pickup_mismatch' | 'at_pickup_fraud';
  reason: string;
  pickupVerificationId?: string;
  evidenceUrls?: string[];
  fraudConfirmed?: boolean;
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  cancellation: {
    id: string;
    shipment_id: string;
    cancellation_type: 'at_pickup_mismatch';
    refund_to_client: 350.00;
    compensation_to_driver: 100.00;
    platform_fee: 50.00;
    refund_status: 'processing';
  },
  shipment: {
    id: string;
    status: 'cancelled';
  }
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Verify authenticated user is driver, client, or admin
2. Get shipment payment details
3. Call database function:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM calculate_cancellation_refund(
     p_original_amount := shipment.estimated_price,
     p_cancellation_type := request.cancellationType,
     p_fraud_confirmed := request.fraudConfirmed
   );
   ```
4. Create cancellation record:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO cancellation_records (
     shipment_id,
     initiated_by,
     initiator_id,
     cancellation_type,
     reason,
     fraud_confirmed,
     original_amount,
     refund_to_client,
     compensation_to_driver,
     platform_fee,
     refund_status,
     pickup_verification_id,
     evidence_urls
   ) VALUES (...);
   ```
5. **Process Stripe refund:**
   ```typescript
   // Get payment intent from shipment
   const paymentIntent = shipment.stripe_payment_intent_id;
   
   // Refund to client
   if (refundData.refund_to_client > 0) {
     const refund = await stripe.refunds.create({
       payment_intent: paymentIntent,
       amount: Math.round(refundData.refund_to_client * 100), // cents
       reason: 'requested_by_customer',
       metadata: {
         shipment_id: shipmentId,
         cancellation_id: cancellation.id,
         cancellation_type: request.cancellationType
       }
     });
     
     // Update cancellation with Stripe refund ID
     UPDATE cancellation_records
     SET stripe_refund_id = refund.id,
         refund_status = 'processing'
     WHERE id = cancellation.id;
   }
   
   // Transfer to driver
   if (refundData.compensation_to_driver > 0) {
     const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
       amount: Math.round(refundData.compensation_to_driver * 100),
       currency: 'usd',
       destination: driver.stripe_account_id,
       metadata: {
         shipment_id: shipmentId,
         cancellation_id: cancellation.id,
         type: 'cancellation_compensation'
       }
     });
     
     // Update with transfer ID
     UPDATE cancellation_records
     SET stripe_transfer_id = transfer.id
     WHERE id = cancellation.id;
   }
   ```
6. Update shipment status to 'cancelled':
   ```sql
   UPDATE shipments
   SET status = 'cancelled',
       cancellation_record_id = cancellation.id,
       updated_at = NOW()
   WHERE id = shipmentId;
   ```
7. Send notifications to both parties
8. If fraud, escalate to admin for review
9. Return cancellation record

**Notifications:**
- Client: "Shipment cancelled. Refund of $X will be processed within 5-10 business days."
- Driver: "Shipment cancelled. Compensation of $X has been transferred."
- Admin (if fraud): "Fraud alert: Shipment {id} cancelled. Review required."

**Error Handling:**
- Stripe refund failed: Mark refund_status = 'failed', notify admin
- Invalid cancellation type: Return error
- Already cancelled: Return error

---

### 3. Simple Status Updates

#### **PATCH /api/shipments/:id/status**

**Purpose:** Generic status update (picked_up, in_transit, delivered)

**Request:**
```typescript
{
  status: 'picked_up' | 'in_transit' | 'delivered';
  notes?: string;
  location?: { lat, lng };
  deliveryPhotos?: string[];  // URLs if delivered
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  shipment: {
    id: string;
    status: 'picked_up';
    updated_at: string;
  }
}
```

**Logic:**
1. Verify authenticated user is the assigned driver
2. Validate status transition using `is_valid_status_transition()`
3. Call `update_shipment_status_safe()`
4. Update relevant timestamp column:
   - picked_up ‚Üí actual_pickup_time
   - delivered ‚Üí actual_delivery_time
5. If delivered, require delivery photos (minimum 3)
6. Send appropriate notification
7. Return updated shipment

**Notifications:**
- picked_up ‚Üí Client: "Your vehicle is loaded and secured!"
- in_transit ‚Üí Client: "Your vehicle is in transit. Track progress."
- delivered ‚Üí Client: "üéâ Your vehicle has been delivered!"

## üîî Notification Service Updates

### Add to NotificationService.ts

```typescript
export class NotificationService {
  /**
   * Send verification alert to client (minor differences found)

## üîí Middleware

### validateStatus.ts (New)

```typescript
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase';

/**
 * Validate status transition before allowing update
 */
export async function validateStatusTransition(

  }
}
```
