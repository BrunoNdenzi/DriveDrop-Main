# Driver Pickup Verification System - Implementation Progress

**Created:** January 30, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2  
**Priority:** HIGH - Critical business logic gap

---

## üìã Executive Summary

We've completed **Phase 1** of implementing a comprehensive driver pickup verification system that addresses a critical business logic gap: clients upload vehicle photos at booking, but drivers had no way to verify vehicle condition at pickup. This created liability risks and dispute potential.

### ‚úÖ What's Been Completed

- ‚úÖ Complete database schema with tables, functions, triggers
- ‚úÖ 9 new shipment statuses for granular tracking
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types for mobile app (pickupVerification.ts, cancellation.ts)
- ‚úÖ Service layer with all API call methods (pickupVerificationService.ts)
- ‚úÖ Status flow documentation with UI specifications
- ‚úÖ Refund calculation logic with fair splits
- ‚úÖ GPS verification for driver location

## üéØ New Shipment Statuses Explained

### The Flow

```
pending ‚Üí accepted ‚Üí driver_en_route ‚Üí driver_arrived 
  ‚Üì
pickup_verification_pending ‚Üí pickup_verified ‚Üí picked_up 
  ‚Üì
in_transit ‚Üí delivered
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | When | Who Can Update | Next Status |
|--------|------|----------------|-------------|
| **pending** | After booking | System | accepted |
| **accepted** | Driver accepts | Driver, Admin | driver_en_route |
| **driver_en_route** | Driver starts trip | Driver | driver_arrived |
| **driver_arrived** | GPS verified at location | Driver (GPS check) | pickup_verification_pending |
| **pickup_verification_pending** | Driver taking photos | Driver | pickup_verified or cancelled |
| **pickup_verified** | Verification complete | Driver, Client | picked_up |
| **picked_up** | Vehicle loaded | Driver | in_transit |
| **in_transit** | Transport started | Driver | delivered |
| **delivered** | Delivery complete | Driver | (terminal) |
| **cancelled** | Any cancellation | Client, Driver, Admin | (terminal) |

### GPS Verification

- Driver must be within **100 meters** of pickup address
- Uses Haversine formula for accuracy
- Prevents fraud/fake arrivals
- Error message shows actual distance if too far

## üí∞ Cancellation & Refund Logic

### Scenario Matrix

| Cancellation Type | Client Refund | Driver Comp | Platform Fee | Who Can Cancel |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Before acceptance | 100% | 0% | 0% | Client, Admin |
| After acceptance, before pickup | 80% | 10% | 10% | Client, Driver, Admin |
| At pickup - mismatch | 70% | 20% | 10% | Driver, Client, Admin |
| At pickup - fraud | 0% | 40% | 60% | Driver, Admin |
| During transit | 50% | 40% | 10% | Admin only |
| Force majeure | 90% | 5% | 5% | Admin, System |

### Calculation Function

The `calculate_cancellation_refund()` database function handles all scenarios:

```sql
SELECT * FROM calculate_cancellation_refund(
  p_original_amount := 500.00,
  p_cancellation_type := 'at_pickup_mismatch',
  p_fraud_confirmed := false
);

-- Returns:
-- client_refund: 350.00 (70%)
-- driver_compensation: 100.00 (20%)
-- platform_fee: 50.00 (10%)
```

---

## üîî Notification Strategy

### Push Notifications (11 events)

1. **accepted** ‚Üí Client: "Driver assigned!"
2. **driver_en_route** ‚Üí Client: "Driver is on the way! ETA: X minutes"
3. **driver_arrived** ‚Üí Client: "Driver has arrived"
4. **pickup_verification_pending** ‚Üí Client: "Driver is verifying vehicle..."
5. **minor_differences_found** ‚Üí Client: "‚ö†Ô∏è Please review and respond within 5 minutes"
6. **pickup_verified** ‚Üí Client: "‚úÖ Vehicle verified! Driver is loading."
7. **picked_up** ‚Üí Client: "Vehicle loaded and secured!"
8. **in_transit** ‚Üí Client: "Vehicle in transit. Track progress."
9. **delivered** ‚Üí Client: "üéâ Vehicle delivered!"
10. **cancelled** ‚Üí Both: "Shipment cancelled. Refund: $X"

### SMS Notifications (Critical Only)

- Driver arrived
- Verification issues found
- Picked up
- Delivered

## üîê Security & Validation

### RLS Policies

```sql
-- Drivers can only see their own verifications
CREATE POLICY "Drivers can view own verifications"
  ON pickup_verifications FOR SELECT
  USING (driver_id = auth.uid());

-- Clients can see verifications for their shipments
CREATE POLICY "Clients can view shipment verifications"
  ON pickup_verifications FOR SELECT
  USING (
    shipment_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM shipments WHERE client_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Only drivers can create verifications
CREATE POLICY "Drivers can create verifications"
  ON pickup_verifications FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (driver_id = auth.uid());
```

### Status Transition Validation

The `is_valid_status_transition()` function prevents invalid jumps:

```sql
-- ALLOWED: accepted ‚Üí driver_en_route
-- ALLOWED: driver_en_route ‚Üí driver_arrived
-- BLOCKED: accepted ‚Üí pickup_verified (must go through en_route, arrived, pending)
-- BLOCKED: pending ‚Üí in_transit (must be accepted first)
```

## üß™ Testing Plan

### Unit Tests Needed

1. **Type helpers**
   - `isVerificationComplete()` with various photo counts
   - `canCancelShipment()` for all status/role combinations
   - `calculateCancellationRefund()` for all 6 scenarios

2. **Service methods**
   - `markDriverArrived()` with GPS within/outside 100m
   - `uploadVerificationPhoto()` with valid/invalid images
   - `submitVerification()` with all decision types

3. **Status transitions**
   - Valid transitions succeed
   - Invalid transitions throw errors
   - RLS policies enforced

### Integration Tests

1. **Full verification flow**
   - Driver en route ‚Üí arrived ‚Üí verification ‚Üí pickup ‚Üí transit ‚Üí delivery
   - Photo upload and retrieval
   - Client approval/dispute flow

2. **Cancellation scenarios**
   - Before acceptance (100% refund)
   - At pickup with mismatch (70% refund)
   - Fraud detection (0% refund)
   - Verify Stripe refund processing

3. **GPS verification**
   - Driver within 100m ‚Üí allowed
   - Driver 200m away ‚Üí blocked with error
   - Calculate distance accuracy

### Manual Testing Checklist
