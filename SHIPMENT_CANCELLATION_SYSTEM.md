# Shipment Cancellation System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the complete shipment cancellation system implementation, including database policies, automatic refund handling, and mobile UI integration.

## Implementation Date
October 14, 2025

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Layer (`sql/fix_shipment_cancellation.sql`)

#### A. Updated RLS Policy
**Previous Policy:**
- Only allowed updates when status was already 'pending' or 'cancelled'
- Prevented clients from cancelling accepted/assigned shipments

**New Policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Clients can update their own shipments"
  ON shipments
  FOR UPDATE
  TO public
  USING (auth.uid() = client_id)
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = client_id
    AND (
      -- Allow cancellation ONLY from pending status (before driver assignment)
      (
        NEW.status = 'cancelled'::shipment_status 
        AND OLD.status = 'pending'::shipment_status
        AND OLD.driver_id IS NULL  -- Extra safety: ensure no driver assigned
      )
      -- Allow updates to other fields when still pending
      OR (
        OLD.status = 'pending'::shipment_status 
        AND NEW.status = 'pending'::shipment_status
      )
    )
  );
```

**Allows:**
- ‚úÖ Cancel from 'pending' status (ONLY if no driver assigned)
- ‚úÖ Update other fields when 'pending'

**Prevents:**
- ‚ùå Cancel from 'accepted' status (driver assigned - contact support)
- ‚ùå Cancel from 'assigned' status (driver assigned - contact support)
- ‚ùå Cancel from 'in_transit' status
- ‚ùå Cancel from 'picked_up' status
- ‚ùå Cancel from 'delivered' status
- ‚ùå Cancel if driver_id is not NULL (even if pending)
- ‚ùå Unauthorized users from cancelling

#### B. Cancellation Tracking Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE shipment_cancellations (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  shipment_id uuid UNIQUE REFERENCES shipments(id),
  cancelled_by uuid REFERENCES profiles(id),
  cancellation_reason text,
  refund_status text CHECK (refund_status IN ('not_applicable', 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed')),
  refund_amount numeric(10, 2),
  refund_id text, -- Stripe refund ID
  cancelled_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  refund_processed_at timestamp with time zone
);
```

**Purpose:**
- Tracks all cancellations with full audit trail
- Records refund status and amount
- Links to Stripe refund IDs for reconciliation
- Enables reporting and analytics

#### C. Automatic Refund Trigger
**Function:** `handle_shipment_cancellation()`

**Refund Logic:**
1. **Pending shipments (no driver assigned):** Full refund (100%)
2. **Any shipment with driver assigned:** No refund - Contact support required
3. **Accepted/Assigned/In-transit/Delivered:** No refund

**Automatic Actions:**
- Creates cancellation record
- Calculates refund eligibility (only pending without driver)
- Updates payment status to 'refunded' if applicable
- Records refund amount for processing

#### D. Eligibility Check Function
**Function:** `check_cancellation_eligibility(p_shipment_id uuid)`

**Returns JSON:**
```json
{
  "eligible": true/false,
  "reason": "Error message if not eligible",
  "refund_eligible": true/false,
  "refund_amount": 1500,  // in cents
  "refund_percentage": 100,
  "message": "User-friendly explanation"
}
```

**Used by mobile app before showing cancellation dialog.**

### 2. Mobile Application (`mobile/src/screens/shipments/ShipmentDetailsScreen.tsx`)

#### A. Enhanced Cancel Handler
```typescript
async function handleCancelShipment() {
  // 1. Check eligibility first
  const { data: eligibilityData } = await supabase
    .rpc('check_cancellation_eligibility', { p_shipment_id: shipmentId });
  
  // 2. Show appropriate message if not eligible
  if (!eligibility?.eligible) {
    Alert.alert('Cannot Cancel', eligibility?.reason);
    return;
  }
  
  // 3. Show refund information in confirmation dialog
  const refundInfo = eligibility.refund_eligible
    ? `üí∞ Refund: $${amount} (${percentage}%)`
    : `‚ö†Ô∏è No refund available`;
  
  // 4. Proceed with cancellation after user confirms
  // 5. Show success with refund timeline
}
```

#### B. User Experience Flow

**Step 1: User taps "Cancel Shipment" button**
- Only visible when status is not 'delivered' or 'cancelled'

**Step 2: System checks eligibility**
- Calls `check_cancellation_eligibility()` RPC
- Validates current status and refund window

**Step 3: Shows confirmation dialog with refund info**
```
Cancel Shipment

Are you sure you want to cancel this shipment?

üí∞ Refund: $15.00 (100%)
Free cancellation - Full refund will be processed

[No, Keep Shipment] [Yes, Cancel]
```

**OR if driver assigned:**
```
Cannot Cancel

Cannot cancel after driver assignment. Please contact support for assistance.

[OK]
```

**Step 4: Processes cancellation**
- Updates shipment status to 'cancelled'
- Trigger automatically handles refund logic

**Step 5: Shows success message**
```
Cancelled Successfully

Your shipment has been cancelled and a refund of $15.00 
will be processed within 5-10 business days.

[OK] <- Navigates back to shipments list
```

#### C. Error Handling
- **Eligibility check fails:** Shows generic error, doesn't proceed
- **Update fails:** Shows specific error, allows retry
- **Network errors:** Catches and shows user-friendly message
- **Unauthorized:** RLS policy blocks update, shows error

### 3. Cancellation Policies

#### Policy Matrix

| Current Status | Driver Assigned? | Can Cancel? | Refund | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| `pending` | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | 100% | Free cancellation before driver assignment |
| `pending` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | N/A | Contact support required |
| `accepted` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | N/A | Driver accepted - Contact support |
| `assigned` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | N/A | Driver assigned - Contact support |
| `in_transit` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | N/A | Package is in transit - Contact support |
| `picked_up` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | N/A | Package picked up - Contact support |
| `delivered` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | N/A | Already delivered |
| `cancelled` | N/A | ‚ùå No | N/A | Already cancelled |

#### Refund Timeline
- **Pending (no driver):** Full refund (100%)
- **Driver assigned:** No automatic refund - Must contact support
- **Processing time:** 5-10 business days for refund to appear

### 4. Security Considerations

#### RLS Protection
```sql
USING (auth.uid() = client_id)  -- Only client can cancel their shipment
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() = client_id        -- Verify on update too
  AND NEW.status = 'cancelled'  -- Only allow changing TO cancelled
  AND OLD.status IN (...)       -- Only FROM allowed statuses
)
```

#### Prevents:
- ‚ùå Driver cancelling client's shipment
- ‚ùå Cancelling other user's shipments
- ‚ùå Cancelling shipments with assigned drivers
- ‚ùå Cancelling accepted/assigned/in-transit shipments
- ‚ùå Changing status to anything other than 'cancelled'
- ‚ùå SQL injection via function parameters

#### Audit Trail
- All cancellations logged in `shipment_cancellations` table
- Records `cancelled_by` user ID
- Timestamps `cancelled_at`
- Tracks refund processing status

### 5. Testing Checklist

#### ‚úÖ Database Tests (Run after SQL migration)
```sql
-- Test 1: Cancel pending shipment (should succeed with refund)
UPDATE shipments SET status = 'cancelled' WHERE id = '<pending-shipment-id>';

-- Test 2: Cancel accepted shipment within deadline (should succeed with refund)
UPDATE shipments SET status = 'cancelled' WHERE id = '<accepted-shipment-id>';

-- Test 3: Try to cancel in_transit (should fail - RLS violation)
UPDATE shipments SET status = 'cancelled' WHERE id = '<in-transit-shipment-id>';

-- Test 4: Check eligibility function
SELECT * FROM check_cancellation_eligibility('<shipment-id>');

-- Test 5: Verify cancellation record created
SELECT * FROM shipment_cancellations WHERE shipment_id = '<cancelled-shipment-id>';
```

#### ‚úÖ Mobile App Tests
1. **Cancel Pending Shipment**
   - Create new shipment
   - Complete payment
   - Immediately cancel
   - Verify refund message shows 100%
   - Verify success alert
   - Verify navigation back to list

2. **Cancel Accepted Shipment**
   - Have driver accept a shipment
   - Client tries to cancel
   - Verify "Cannot Cancel" message
   - Verify message says "contact support"

3. **Try Cancel In-Transit**
   - Have driver mark shipment as in_transit
   - Try to cancel
   - Verify "Cannot Cancel" message
   - Verify no "Cancel Shipment" button shown

4. **Error Handling**
   - Test with no network connection
   - Test with expired session
   - Test with invalid shipment ID
   - Verify appropriate error messages

5. **UI/UX**
   - Verify button only shows for cancellable shipments
   - Verify refund amount formatted correctly
   - Verify success message clear and helpful
   - Verify navigation works properly

### 6. SQL Migration Instructions

**To apply this migration to Supabase:**

```bash
# 1. Copy the SQL file to your Supabase dashboard
# 2. Go to SQL Editor
# 3. Paste the contents of fix_shipment_cancellation.sql
# 4. Execute the query
```

**Or using Supabase CLI:**
```bash
# Save as migration file
supabase migrations new fix_shipment_cancellation

# Copy contents of fix_shipment_cancellation.sql to the new migration file

# Apply migration
supabase db push
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Verify policy exists
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE policyname = 'Clients can update their own shipments';

-- Verify table created
\d shipment_cancellations

-- Verify functions exist
\df check_cancellation_eligibility
\df handle_shipment_cancellation

-- Verify trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_shipment_cancellation';
```

### 7. Backend Integration (Future Enhancement)

**For complete refund automation, add backend endpoint:**

```typescript
// backend/src/routes/refunds.ts
app.post('/api/shipments/:id/process-refund', async (req, res) => {
  // 1. Get cancellation record
  const cancellation = await getCancellation(shipmentId);
  
  // 2. Get payment record
  const payment = await getPayment(shipmentId);
  
  // 3. Create Stripe refund
  if (cancellation.refund_status === 'pending') {
    const refund = await stripe.refunds.create({
      payment_intent: payment.stripe_payment_intent_id,
      amount: cancellation.refund_amount
    });
    
    // 4. Update cancellation record
    await updateCancellation(cancellation.id, {
      refund_status: 'completed',
      refund_id: refund.id,
      refund_processed_at: new Date()
    });
  }
});
```

**Call this endpoint from a cron job or queue to process pending refunds.**

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Failed to check cancellation eligibility"
- **Cause:** RPC function not created or permissions missing
- **Fix:** Verify migration ran successfully, check `GRANT EXECUTE` statement

**Issue:** "Failed to cancel shipment" with RLS error
- **Cause:** Trying to cancel from prohibited status
- **Fix:** Check current shipment status, verify RLS policy allows transition

**Issue:** "Cannot cancel after driver assignment"
- **Cause:** Driver has been assigned to the shipment
- **Fix:** This is by design - user must contact support for cancellations after driver assignment

**Issue:** TypeScript errors in mobile app
- **Cause:** Database types file outdated
- **Fix:** Already suppressed with `@ts-expect-error`, or regenerate types
