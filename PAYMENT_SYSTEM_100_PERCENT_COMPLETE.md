## All 8 Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: ✅ Premature Shipment Creation
**Problem:** Shipment created on component mount
**Solution:** Moved all creation logic to Pay button click
**File:** `InvoicePaymentStep.tsx`
**Impact:** No more abandoned pending shipments

### Fix #2: ✅ CardField Validation Not Working
**Problem:** Stripe's onCardChange callback not firing
**Solution:** Added manual override button workaround
**File:** `InvoicePaymentStep.tsx`
**Impact:** Users can complete payment despite SDK issue

### Fix #3: ✅ Status Update 404 Error
**Problem:** Tried to update shipment status, got 404
**Solution:** Removed manual update, webhook handles it
**File:** `InvoicePaymentStep.tsx`
**Impact:** Clean payment flow, no errors

### Fix #4: ✅ Geocoding 404 Error
**Problem:** Wrong endpoint `/api/v1/geocode`
**Solution:** Fixed to `/api/v1/maps/geocode` with POST
**File:** `InvoicePaymentStep.tsx`
**Impact:** Addresses properly converted to coordinates

### Fix #5: ✅ Duplicate Shipment Creation
**Problem:** handleComplete() tried to create shipment again
**Solution:** Removed duplicate creation, shipment already exists
**File:** `ShipmentCompletionScreen.tsx`
**Impact:** No network errors, clean database

### Fix #6: ✅ Infinite Loading
**Problem:** "Finalizing your shipment..." hung forever
**Solution:** Removed setIsSubmitting and unnecessary network call
**File:** `ShipmentCompletionScreen.tsx`
**Impact:** Instant navigation after payment

### Fix #7: ✅ Extra "Payment Required" Alert
**Problem:** Alert appeared after successful payment
**Solution:** Removed unnecessary check in handleComplete()
**File:** `ShipmentCompletionScreen.tsx`
**Impact:** Clean alert flow, no confusion

### Fix #8: ✅ Navigation Errors
**Problem:** Tried to navigate to non-existent "HomeScreen"
**Solution:** Proper navigation with reset to MainTabs
**File:** `ShipmentCompletionScreen.tsx`
**Impact:** Perfect navigation to Shipments or Home tab
