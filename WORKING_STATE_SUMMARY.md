5. If successful, consider this the stable base for future features

## üìù Notes
- Payment button now has visual feedback (activeOpacity + console logs)
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Clean git state, ready for production build
- Discarded remaining main branch features (3 features)
- Focus on stability over feature completeness
