## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Used
- `react-native` - Core framework
- `expo-image-picker` - Avatar selection
- `@expo/vector-icons` (MaterialIcons) - Icon library
- `react-native-safe-area-context` - SafeAreaView
- Supabase client - Database & Storage

### Database Interactions
**Queries**:
- `profiles` table - User profile data
- `shipments` table - Stats (counts, totals, status)
- `driver_ratings` table - Rating averages
- `driver_settings` table - Driver preferences
- `notification_preferences` table - Notification settings
- `privacy_settings` table - Privacy settings

**Storage**:
- `profiles` bucket - Avatar uploads

### State Management
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- AuthContext (useAuth hook)
- Local state for forms and settings
- RefreshControl for pull-to-refresh

### TypeScript
- Full type safety with interfaces
- Proper prop types
- Interface definitions for all data structures
- Clean type annotations

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all async operations
- Error code checking (PGRST116, 42P01)
- Graceful fallbacks for missing tables
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states for async operations

## Error Status

### ✅ No Critical Errors
- Client ProfileScreen: **0 errors**
- Driver ProfileScreen: **0 errors**

### ⚠️ TypeScript Type Warnings (Non-Critical)
- NotificationSettingsScreen: Type warnings for `notification_preferences` table
- PrivacySettingsScreen: Type warnings for `privacy_settings` table

**Reason**: These tables don't exist in the Supabase schema yet, so TypeScript doesn't know their structure. The code handles this gracefully with error code checking (`42P01` for missing table, `PGRST116` for no rows).

**Impact**: None - The app will work correctly when tables are added to the database schema.
