# Production Bug Fixes - October 21, 2025

## Overview
Fixed **six critical production issues** affecting app stability, user experience, and pricing accuracy in the DriveDrop mobile application.

## Latest Updates (January 21, 2025)

### âœ… Issue #6: Auth Refresh Token Error
**Fixed harmless but noisy error during sign out**
- Error: "AuthApiError: Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found"
- Cause: Clearing state before calling auth.signOut() removed refresh token
- Solution: Reordered operations + error filtering
- See: AuthContext.tsx lines 165-185

### âœ… Issue #7: Pricing Calculation Inconsistencies ðŸ”¥ **CRITICAL**
**Frontend missing 25-35% of pricing logic**
- Symptom: "75202â†’92116 almost correct but other distances way off"
- Root Cause: Missing delivery type multiplier (Â±25%), fuel adjustment (Â±5%), and minimum quote logic
- Solution: Complete rewrite of calculateQuote() to match backend
- Impact: Prices now 25% higher for expedited, 5% lower for flexible deliveries
- See: `PRICING_CALCULATION_FIX.md` for detailed analysis

## Original Issues (October 21, 2025)

Fixed four critical production issues affecting app stability, user experience, and data quality in the DriveDrop mobile application.

---

## Issue #1: Blank Screen on App Launch/Sign Out âœ… FIXED

### Problem
- **Symptom**: App intermittently shows blank screen when launching or after signing out
- **Impact**: Users unable to use app, forced to close and restart
- **Root Cause**: Race condition in auth state management during sign out and auth state transitions

### Solution
Enhanced AuthContext.tsx with improved state management:

**File Modified**: `mobile/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`

**Changes Made**:

1. **Immediate State Clearing on Sign Out** (Lines 166-180)
```typescript
const signOut = async () => {
  try {
    // Clear state immediately to prevent blank screen
    setUser(null);
    setUserProfile(null);
    setSession(null);
    setLoading(false);
    
    // Then sign out from Supabase
    await auth.signOut();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error signing out:', error);
    // Even if sign out fails, ensure state is cleared
    setUser(null);
    setUserProfile(null);
    setSession(null);
    setLoading(false);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

2. **Immediate SIGNED_OUT Event Handling** (Lines 230-237)
```typescript
// Handle sign out immediately
if (event === 'SIGNED_OUT') {
  setSession(null);
  setUser(null);
  setUserProfile(null);
  setLoading(false);
  return;
}
```

**Benefits**:
- State cleared synchronously before async operations
- Navigation updates immediately without waiting for Supabase
- Fallback handling ensures state consistency even on errors
- Prevents blank screen during auth transitions

**Testing**: Sign in and out multiple times, close and reopen app repeatedly

## Issue #2: Vehicle Year 2020 Validation Problem âœ… FIXED

### Problem
- **Symptom**: Year input "2020" causes validation error (same as placeholder)
- **Impact**: Users unable to enter 2020 as vehicle year, form validation fails
- **Root Cause**: Placeholder text "2020" confused with actual input, weak validation logic

### Solution
Enhanced vehicle year input with better UX and validation:

**File Modified**: `mobile/src/components/ConsolidatedShipmentForm.tsx`

**Changes Made**:

1. **Improved Placeholder** (Lines 749-755)
```typescript
<TextInput
  style={styles.textInput}
  value={formData.vehicleYear}
  onChangeText={(value) => updateField('vehicleYear', value)}
  placeholder="e.g., 2020"  // Changed from "2020"
  placeholderTextColor="#999"
  keyboardType="numeric"
  maxLength={4}  // Added length limit
/>
```

2. **Robust Year Validation** (Lines 485-495)
```typescript
const yearNum = parseInt(formData.vehicleYear);
const yearValid = formData.vehicleYear && 
                  formData.vehicleYear.length === 4 && 
                  !isNaN(yearNum) && 
                  yearNum >= 1900 && 
                  yearNum <= new Date().getFullYear() + 2;
const vehicleValid = !!(formData.vehicleType && formData.vehicleMake && formData.vehicleModel && yearValid);
```

**Validation Rules**:
- Must be exactly 4 digits
- Must be a valid number (not NaN)
- Range: 1900 to (current year + 2)
- Required for form submission

**Benefits**:
- Clear distinction between placeholder and actual input
- Accepts all valid years including 2020
- Prevents future years (beyond +2)
- Prevents invalid historical years

## Issue #3: Limited Vehicle Makes and Models âœ… FIXED

### Problem
- **Symptom**: Users unable to find their vehicle make/model in dropdown
- **Impact**: Cannot create shipments for many common vehicles, poor UX
- **Root Cause**: Hard-coded vehicle list limited to ~12-15 makes per type

### Solution
Integrated comprehensive USA vehicle database with 45+ manufacturers:

**File Modified**: `mobile/src/components/ConsolidatedShipmentForm.tsx`

**Changes Made**:

1. **Imported Comprehensive Data** (Line 21)
```typescript
import { USA_VEHICLE_DATA } from '../data/vehicleData';
```

2. **Dynamic Database Builder** (Lines 54-68)
```typescript
const buildStandardVehicleDatabase = () => {
  const database: Record<string, Record<string, string[]>> = {};
  const standardTypes = ['Sedan', 'SUV', 'Truck', 'Coupe', 'Convertible', 'Van'];
  
  standardTypes.forEach(type => {
    database[type] = {};
    USA_VEHICLE_DATA.forEach(make => {
      database[type][make.name] = make.models;
    });
  });
  
  return database;
};
```

3. **Enhanced Database Structure** (Lines 70-104)
```typescript
const VEHICLE_DATABASE = {
  ...buildStandardVehicleDatabase(),  // All USA makes for standard types
  'Motorcycle': { /* specialized data */ },
  'RV/Trailer': { /* specialized data */ },
  'Boat': { /* specialized data */ },
  'Heavy Equipment': { /* specialized data */ }
};
```

**Coverage Expansion**:

**Before**: 12-15 makes per type
**After**: 45+ makes for standard vehicles

**Included Manufacturers** (partial list):
- Acura, Audi, BMW, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Dodge
- Ford, Genesis, GMC, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jaguar, Jeep
- Kia, Land Rover, Lexus, Lincoln, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mini, Mitsubishi
- Nissan, Porsche, Ram, Subaru, Tesla, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo
- Plus: Specialized manufacturers for Motorcycles, RVs, Boats, Heavy Equipment

**Model Coverage**: Each manufacturer includes comprehensive model lineup (e.g., Toyota has 23+ models including 4Runner, 86, Avalon, Camry, C-HR, Corolla, Corolla Cross, Crown, GR86, GR Corolla, GR Supra, Highlander, Land Cruiser, Mirai, Prius, Prius Prime, RAV4, RAV4 Prime, Sequoia, Sienna, Tacoma, Tundra, Venza)

**Benefits**:
- Users can find virtually any USA-market vehicle
- Maintains type-specific filtering (Sedan vs SUV vs Truck)
- Special categories (Motorcycle, RV, Boat) retain specialized data
- Automatic updates when USA_VEHICLE_DATA is maintained

## Issue #4: Driver Shipment Cancellation Status âœ… VERIFIED CORRECT

### Problem
- **User Request**: "status should be 'Cancelled'" when driver cancels shipment
- **Investigation**: Verify correct status value is being used

### Findings
System already implements correct behavior:

**Database Enum** (`supabase/migrations/08_add_picked_up_status.sql`):
```sql
CREATE TYPE shipment_status_new AS ENUM (
  'pending', 'accepted', 'assigned', 'in_transit', 
  'in_progress', 'delivered', 'completed', 'cancelled', 'picked_up'
);
```

**Code Implementation** (`mobile/src/screens/driver/ShipmentDetailsScreen.tsx`):

1. **Status Update** (Line 179)
```typescript
status: newStatus as 'pending' | 'completed' | 'draft' | 'accepted' | 
        'assigned' | 'in_transit' | 'in_progress' | 'delivered' | 
        'cancelled' | 'picked_up' | 'open',
```

2. **Display Formatting** (Line 320)
```typescript
{shipment.status.replace('_', ' ').toUpperCase()}
// 'cancelled' â†’ 'CANCELLED'
```

**Result**: 
- Database stores: `'cancelled'` (lowercase, as per enum)
- UI displays: `'CANCELLED'` (uppercase, via .toUpperCase())
- **No changes needed** - system working as designed
