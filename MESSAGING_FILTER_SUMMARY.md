# ✅ Messaging Conversations - Status Filtering Applied

## What Changed

The conversations list now **only shows active shipments** to keep the messaging interface clean and focused.

---

## 🎯 Visible Shipments

| Status | Shown? | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **picked_up** | ✅ YES | Driver has vehicle - needs communication |
| **in_transit** | ✅ YES | Active delivery - needs communication |
| **delivered** | ✅ YES | Completed - may need follow-up |
| pending | ❌ NO | No driver yet - no conversation possible |
| accepted | ❌ NO | Not active yet - coordination via shipment details |
| cancelled | ❌ NO | Job cancelled - not relevant |

## 📝 Code Change

**File**: `mobile/src/screens/ConversationsScreen.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
.from('conversation_summaries')
.select('*')
.order('last_message_at', { ascending: false, nullsFirst: false });
```

**After**:
```typescript
.from('conversation_summaries')
.select('*')
.in('shipment_status', ['picked_up', 'in_transit', 'delivered'])  // ← NEW FILTER
.order('last_message_at', { ascending: false, nullsFirst: false });
```

## 🚀 Benefits

✅ **Cleaner UI** - No confusing "No Driver Assigned" conversations  
✅ **Focused** - Only shows shipments that need communication  
✅ **Efficient** - Database-level filtering (fast)  
✅ **Real-time** - Automatically updates as statuses change

## 📱 User Experience

### Client View
- **Before pickup**: No conversation shown (shipment is pending/accepted)
- **After pickup**: Conversation appears → can message driver
- **During delivery**: Messages active
- **After delivery**: Conversation stays for follow-up questions

### Driver View
- Only sees conversations for shipments they're actively working on
- Past deliveries accessible for reference
- No clutter from pending/accepted jobs

## 🔄 Shipment Lifecycle

```
CREATE → ACCEPT → PICKUP → TRANSIT → DELIVER
  ❌       ❌        ✅        ✅         ✅
(no chat) (no chat) (CHAT!)  (CHAT!)  (CHAT!)
```

---

## ✅ Testing

To test, create shipments with different statuses:

1. **Pending shipment** → Should NOT appear in Messages tab
2. **Accepted shipment** → Should NOT appear in Messages tab
3. **Change to picked_up** → Should APPEAR in Messages tab
4. **Change to in_transit** → Should STAY in Messages tab
5. **Change to delivered** → Should STAY in Messages tab (for follow-up)
6. **Change to cancelled** → Should DISAPPEAR from Messages tab
