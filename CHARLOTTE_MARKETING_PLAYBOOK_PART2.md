Example Post:

The Hidden Cost of Employee Relocation: Vehicle Shipping

When relocating employees to Charlotte, most companies focus on:
✓ Housing assistance
✓ Moving truck rental
✓ Temporary lodging

But what about their vehicles?

The average employee spends:
• $800-1,200 driving cross-country (gas + hotels)
• 3-5 days of lost productivity
• Wear & tear on personal vehicle

Smart companies are now including vehicle shipping in relocation packages:
• Costs ~$600-800 (comparable to driving)
• Employee arrives rested, ready to work Day 1
• No personal vehicle depreciation

At DriveDrop, we've partnered with 5 Charlotte companies to include vehicle shipping in their relocation benefits.

HR Directors: Let's talk about how this can improve your employee experience.
