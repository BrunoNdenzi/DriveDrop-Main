# 🔧 Price & Text Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Changed "Accept Job" to "Apply for Job" in Driver Dashboard

**Problem:** Driver home screen showed "Accept Job" button which was misleading, as drivers apply for jobs and clients accept/assign them.

**File:** `mobile/src/screens/driver/DriverDashboardScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Line 254 - BEFORE
{job.hasApplied ? 'Applied' : 'Accept Job'}

// Line 254 - AFTER
{job.hasApplied ? 'Applied' : 'Apply for Job'}
```

**Impact:** 
- ✅ Clearer user intent - drivers "apply" for jobs
- ✅ Consistent with other screens (AvailableJobsScreen, AvailableShipmentsScreen)
- ✅ Better UX - matches the actual workflow

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Driver Profile Total Earnings Calculation

**Problem:** Total earnings in driver profile tab was calculated using `price` field instead of `estimated_price`, which resulted in incorrect totals (often showing $0 or wrong amounts).

**File:** `mobile/src/screens/driver/DriverProfileScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Lines 107-113 - BEFORE
const { data: earnings } = await supabase
  .from('shipments')
  .select('price')  // ❌ Wrong field
  .eq('driver_id', userProfile.id)
  .eq('status', 'delivered');

const totalEarnings = earnings?.reduce((sum, job) => sum + (job.price || 0), 0) || 0;

// Lines 107-113 - AFTER
const { data: earnings } = await supabase
  .from('shipments')
  .select('estimated_price')  // ✅ Correct field
  .eq('driver_id', userProfile.id)
  .eq('status', 'delivered');

const totalEarnings = earnings?.reduce((sum, job) => sum + (job.estimated_price || 0), 0) || 0;
```

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ `estimated_price` is the standard field used throughout the app for shipment pricing
- ✅ Matches the price shown in completed jobs lists
- ✅ Consistent with client side calculations
- ✅ Database schema uses `estimated_price` as primary price field

**Result:** Driver profile now shows correct total earnings matching sum of all completed shipments

### 3. ✅ Fixed TypeScript Error in DriverDashboardScreen

**Problem:** TypeScript error when updating driver settings because `userProfile?.id` could be undefined.

**File:** `mobile/src/screens/driver/DriverDashboardScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Lines 82-92 - BEFORE
const handleStartShift = async () => {
  try {
    setIsAvailable(!isAvailable);
    await supabase
      .from('driver_settings')
      .upsert({
        driver_id: userProfile?.id,  // ❌ Could be undefined
        available_for_jobs: !isAvailable,
        updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      });

// Lines 82-97 - AFTER
const handleStartShift = async () => {
  try {
    if (!userProfile?.id) {  // ✅ Check for undefined
      Alert.alert('Error', 'User not authenticated');
      return;
    }
    
    setIsAvailable(!isAvailable);
    await supabase
      .from('driver_settings')
      .upsert({
        driver_id: userProfile.id,  // ✅ Safe to use
        available_for_jobs: !isAvailable,
        updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      });
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Proper error handling if user is not authenticated
- ✅ Prevents database errors

## Price Formatting - Current Implementation (Verified Correct)

### InvoicePaymentStep.tsx - ✅ Already Correct

The price formatting in the payment step is working correctly:

```typescript
// Lines 48-51
const quotePriceDollars = shipmentData.estimatedPrice || 0; // In dollars from backend
const quotePrice = Math.round(quotePriceDollars * 100); // Convert to cents for Stripe

// Calculate payment breakdown: 20% upfront, 80% on delivery
const upfrontAmount = Math.round(quotePrice * 0.20);
const deliveryAmount = quotePrice - upfrontAmount;
```

**Why this is correct:**
1. Backend returns `estimatedPrice` in **DOLLARS** (e.g., 122.64)
2. Stripe requires amounts in **CENTS** (e.g., 12264)
3. Display shows in **DOLLARS** using `(upfrontAmount / 100).toFixed(2)`

**Example calculation:**
- estimatedPrice: $122.64 (from backend)
- quotePrice: 12264 cents (for Stripe)
- upfrontAmount: 2453 cents (20%)
- Display: $24.53 (2453 / 100)

This is the standard Stripe payment integration pattern.

## Database Schema Reference

### Shipments Table - Price Fields

```sql
-- Current schema
CREATE TABLE shipments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  estimated_price DECIMAL(10, 2),  -- ✅ Primary price field (in dollars)
  price DECIMAL(10, 2),            -- ⚠️ Legacy/alternative field (rarely used)
  final_price DECIMAL(10, 2),      -- Final price after delivery
  payment_status TEXT,
  -- ... other fields
);
```

**Standard practice:**
- Use `estimated_price` for quotes and display
- Use `final_price` for completed shipments (if different from estimate)
- `price` field is legacy and should be phased out

## Testing Checklist

### Driver Dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to Driver Dashboard
- [ ] Check "Available Jobs" section
- [ ] Verify button says **"Apply for Job"** (not "Accept Job")
- [ ] Click button to apply - should work correctly

### Driver Profile
- [ ] Navigate to Driver Profile tab
- [ ] Check "Total Earnings" amount
- [ ] Verify it matches sum of completed shipment prices
- [ ] Compare with "My Shipments" > "Completed" tab totals

**How to verify earnings are correct:**

1. **Query database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(estimated_price) as total_earnings
   FROM shipments
   WHERE driver_id = '<YOUR_DRIVER_ID>'
   AND status = 'delivered';
   ```

2. **Compare with Profile screen** - should match exactly

3. **Check individual completed shipments:**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, estimated_price, status, updated_at
   FROM shipments
   WHERE driver_id = '<YOUR_DRIVER_ID>'
   AND status = 'delivered'
   ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
   ```

### Payment Flow
- [ ] Create a new shipment
- [ ] Navigate to payment screen
- [ ] Check quote price displayed
- [ ] Verify 20% upfront amount is correct
- [ ] Complete payment
- [ ] Verify amounts in database match displayed amounts

## No Breaking Changes

All changes are:
- ✅ **Non-breaking** - existing functionality preserved
- ✅ **Bug fixes** - correcting incorrect behavior
- ✅ **Text updates** - improving clarity
- ✅ **Type safety** - fixing TypeScript errors

---

## Database Impact

**No database migrations needed** - all changes are in the mobile app code.

The database already has the `estimated_price` field, we're just using it correctly now.

---

## Deployment Notes

1. **Test the changes** using the checklist above
2. **Verify no regressions** in other parts of the app
3. **Monitor driver profile earnings** after deployment
4. **Check that "Apply for Job" button works** as expected
